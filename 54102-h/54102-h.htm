    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> THICK, wet night
      on the southwest coast of Lake Michigan a dozen years ago; a wind that
      sweeps over the pitching lake and on over the dim white beach with a rush
      that whirls the sand up and away. Trees are bending up there on the bluff.
      The sand and the rain are in the air&mdash;or do we feel the spray from
      yonder line of breakers, a hundred yards away?
    </p>
    <p>
      And deep in a mudhole on the lonely road that skirts the bluff&mdash;the
      four horses, fetlock-deep in the sticky clay, straining forward like
      heroes, the members of the student crew in their oilskins throwing their
      weight on the wheels of the truck&mdash;is the Evanston surf-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver has pulled his sou'wester hat down on his neck behind and swung
      the U. S. L. S. S. lantern on his arm; he stands beside the forward wheel,
      cracks his long whip and swears vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on a minute, boys,&rdquo; he calls over his shoulder; and he must shout it
      twice before he is heard. &ldquo;Whoa, there! Stand back! Now, boys, get your
      breath and try it together. When I call&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Now. All
      ready! Let her go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men throw themselves on the spokes, the horses plunge forward under
      the lash of the whip. A moment of straining&mdash;an uncertain moment&mdash;then
      the wheels turn slowly forward, the horses' feet draw out with a sucking
      sound, and the boat rolls ahead. The driver unbuttons his oilskins at the
      waist and reaches beneath an under coat for his watch. They have been out
      two hours; distance covered, two miles. Before him is darkness, save where
      the lantern throws a yellow circle on the ground; behind him is darkness,
      save for the white boat, the little group of panting, grunting men, and, a
      long mile to the southward, the gleaming eye of the Grosse Pointe
      lighthouse, now red, now white. But somewhere in the darkness ahead,
      somewhere beyond the white of the breakers, a big steamer is pounding
      herself to pieces on the bar. So he buttons his coat and shifts the reins
      and swears at the horses. He seems to swear easily, this young fellow; but
      he is thinking of the poor devils on the big steamer, lashed to the mast
      perhaps, if the masts are still standing; and he is wondering how many of
      them will ever ship again.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
      A huge bonfire lighted up beach and breakers. Around it huddled a motley
      crowd, students in rain-coats or sweaters, sober citizens and residents of
      the north shore, fishermen, and all the village loafers. But the students
      were in the majority and were making most of the noise. It was they who
      had built the fire, raiding fences and wood-yards to send up a blaze that
      should tell the poor fellows out yonder of the warmth and comfort awaiting
      them on shore&mdash;if they should ever get in through the surf. They were
      cheering, too, giving the college yells and shouting out inspiriting
      messages&mdash;as if any noise below the sound of a gun or a steam
      fog-horn could hope to be heard over the roar of the lake! But this was a
      great occasion and must be made the most of.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course no such body of students could act in concert without a
      recognized leader; and the young man who claimed the honour could be
      distinguished at a glance. Now issuing orders to the foragers, now
      mounting the pile to adjust with a flourish the top barrel and to pour out
      the last can of kerosene, now heading the war-dance around the crackling
      fire or leading the yells with an improvised baton, always in evidence, as
      busy and breathless as though his labours had an aim&mdash;was a
      long-faced, long-legged student. He wore a cap that was too small to hide
      his curly chestnut hair. His face was good-natured, if flushed with the
      responsibilities of his position. His rain-coat thrown aside, he stood
      attired in a white sweater with a wide-rolling collar, and a pair of
      striped trousers that fitted close to his nimble legs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, there! Here they come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A small boy was shouting. He had been stationed on the bluff; and now he
      was sliding down, using his trousers as a toboggan on the steep clay.
      &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The news spread. &ldquo;Here they come!&rdquo; was passed from mouth to mouth. Those
      who had gone out of the firelight, in order to get a glimpse of the hulk
      that stood out dimly against the horizon, now came running back and joined
      their voices to the cheer that was rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, they had come. A Coston signal was burning up on the bluff; and half
      a hundred pair of legs were running up the beach to lend a hundred hands
      in getting a ton and more of surf-boat down the ravine road. The tall
      young man led the way, thanks to the nimble legs, and called over his
      shoulder as he ran:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This way, boys! Everybody this way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horses were taken out in a hurry and led off to the nearest barn. Long
      ropes were rigged to the back axle, &ldquo;everybody&rdquo; laid hold, and then, with
      the crew men still hanging to the spokes and the young driver leaning back
      on the tongue to guide the forward wheels, the surf-boat went bumping and
      lurching down the road. With a rush and a cheer she went, as if the fever
      of the waiting crowd had got into the wheels, as if the desperate hands of
      the half-drowned men out yonder were hauling them on&mdash;impatiently,
      madly, courageously hauling them on.
    </p>
    <p>
      On down the beach, the broad wheels plowing through the sand; on toward
      the breakers that came running to meet them: into the water with a splash
      and a plunge, until ankles were wet and knees were wet&mdash;then a halt.
      The eight young men in oilskins bustled about the boat, their yellow coats
      and hats glistening in the firelight; and the crowd stood silent at the
      water's edge, looking first at them and then at the black-and-white sea
      out yonder&mdash;and an ugly sea it was. But in a moment the confusion
      resolved into harmony. The eight men fell into place around the boat,
      lashed on their cork jackets, laid hold of the gunwales, ran her out into
      the surf, tumbled aboard&mdash;and the fight was on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a fight that made those young fellows set their teeth hard as their
      backs bent over the oars. They did not know that this storm had strewn the
      coast with wrecks; they did not know that the veteran crew at Chicago had
      refused to venture out in their big English life-boat. And they did not
      care. Too young to be prudent, too strong to be afraid, these youngsters
      fought for the sake of the fighting; and they loved it. So they worked
      through the surf with never a thought of failure, with never a thought
      that the white waves might beat them back; and they shook the water out of
      their eyes and watched Number Two, who was pulling stroke to-night, and
      went in to win. And all the while the young man standing erect in the
      stern, swinging the twenty-foot steering-oar, was swearing, letting out a
      flow of language that would, as Number Two said afterward, have made a
      crab go forwards. It was plain that he was enjoying it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire was sinking; the drizzle was cold and penetrating. The little
      groups down on the hard sand near the water were tired of straining their
      eyes into the blackness. The moment of enthusiasm was past. The surf-boat
      had slipped away like a dream&mdash;a moment of tossing against the sky, a
      glimpse of set faces, a shout or two over the pounding surf, then the
      lead-black lake with its white flecks, the lead-black sky, and the spot of
      deeper black where the steamer lay. A shivering fellow brought an armful
      of driftwood from a dry nook and threw it on the fire. The idea was good
      and the others took it up. Soon the flames were leaping up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now what more natural than a song! The bleached-out bones of a
      forty-ton lumber schooner lay curving up from the sand; here mounted a
      student, he of the white sweater and long legs, and the others crowded
      around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Apples; let her go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And they sang out merrily there, with the glare of the fire in their wet
      faces and the wildness of the lake in their throats:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;Oh, my name is Captain Hall, Captain Hall!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      A rush of wind carried the next words down the beach; but the last lines
      came out strong:
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      &ldquo;Hope to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;you go to Hell!
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Hope to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; you're roasted well!
    </p>
    <p class="indent30">
      Damn your eyes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi-yi!&rdquo;&mdash;it is the small boy again. &ldquo;There she is! There she is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Out there&mdash;off the breakwater! There&mdash;see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the straining eyes, again the lead-black of the sky and water. Is
      that the boat, that speck of white away out, or is it a whitecap? Now it
      is gone. Has the boat dropped into a hollow of the sea? Who knows! A white
      speck here, another there, white specks everywhere! &ldquo;Boy, you're
      dreaming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure he's dreaming. They haven't been gone twenty minutes. What's the
      matter with you!&rdquo; Yes, it is only twenty minutes; and there is a weary,
      bitter hour yet for the poor devils before they may set foot on land.
      Another song is the cry; and more wood&mdash;heap her up! Again Apples
      mounts his grim perch&mdash;the head- and footstone of half a dozen
      forgotten sailors&mdash;and marches the &ldquo;Grand Old Duke of York&rdquo; up the
      hill, and marches him down again; and when he was up he was up, up, up;
      and when he was down he was down, down, down; and when he was only half
      way up he was neither up nor down; and the rain thickens; and the smoke
      and flames run along parallel to the sand, so fierce is the wind; and the
      poor devils out yonder call up what prayers they may have known in
      childhood&mdash;and lucky the sailor who remembers how those prayers used
      to go!
    </p>
    <p>
      There is more singing and more watching; then, after a long while, the
      boat is sighted. She is coming in from the north, making full allowance
      for the set of the surf. As she works slowly nearer they can make out the
      figure of the steersman and the huddled lot of crew men and sailors. The
      fire is renewed again and a shout goes up. She hovers outside the line of
      surf, then lifts on a roller and comes swiftly in to the sand, so swiftly
      that the oars must be hauled in with a rush, and the crew must tumble out,
      waist-deep, and catch the gunwales and heave her forward before the wave
      glides back.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one man in the stem, rolling about between the feet of Number
      Two. Even in that uncertain light, and bedraggled as he is, it is plain
      that his dress is of a different quality from that of the sailors.
      Bareheaded he is, and one can see the white in his hair and the wrinkles
      on his smooth-shaven face. It seems, too, that he wants the physique of
      his companions, most of whom are able, for all the exposure, to spring out
      without assistance. The steersman, who has been watching him with some
      anxiety, leans over and helps him out, and then, swinging him on his
      shoulders, carries him pickaback up out of the water and toward the fire.
      Word goes around that this is the owner of the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Jack,&rdquo; calls Apples, bobbing up close at hand, &ldquo;you're to go up to
      the house on the bluff. They are making coffee for all the boys. Let me
      give you a hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steersman makes no reply, but, as his burden protests that he can
      walk, lets him down, and each young man takes an arm. In a few moments
      they are all, rescuers and rescued, in a hospitable kitchen drinking black
      coffee and crowding, with steaming clothes, about the range. The steersman
      drinks a second cup at a gulp and looks around for his men. He is not
      joining in the talk, for a heavy responsibility rests on him, but his eyes
      have the blaze of excitement in them and his square jaw is set hard. His
      white, drawn face shows that the work is telling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; he says quietly. &ldquo;Time for the next trip.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Quiet falls on the room that was just now loud with talk. It continues
      while the crew men toss down their coffee, hastily retie their cork
      jackets, and file out into the night. The sailors have been exultant over
      their rescue; but now they are reminded of the comrades out yonder, and
      they fall into moody silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      But after all, it is a great thing to be alive when one has been clinging
      to a rope in a desperate sea with ugly thoughts to face. At any rate,
      these men seemed to find it so; for, after a time, when doubtless the
      white surf-boat was bobbing far out, one of the hundred white flecks on
      the black lake; when doubtless the poor fellows who had to wait, old
      Captain Craig with them, were still cursing and praying&mdash;and one of
      them had wept foolish tears when they parted&mdash;they fell back into
      talk. The drama had reached but the second act, and no one could say if it
      was to be a tragedy, but the warm kitchen and the plentiful coffee, and
      the thoughtless talk of the half-dozen students who had followed them in,
      were not to be resisted. Within half an hour the banter and jokes were
      flying fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The elderly man, whose name was Higginson, was sitting close to the range,
      wrapped in a blanket. He found Apples at his elbow and spoke to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What crew is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Evanston crew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man nodded and was silent, but after a few moments he spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was that young man in the stem? Is he the Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the Captain is sick. He is Number One.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is his name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloran&mdash;Jack Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER I&mdash;Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n a mahogany
      office high up in a very high building sat Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow. An
      elaborate building it was, with expensive statuary about the entrance,
      with unusually expensive mosaic floors on all of the fifteen or more
      stories. A dozen elevators were at Mr. Bigelow's service, and a dozen
      uniformed elevator boys to bow deferentially whenever he granted his brief
      presence in the necessary actions of going up to his office or coming down
      from his office&mdash;boys that were fond of remarking casually when the
      great man had stepped out, &ldquo;That's G. Hyde Bigelow.&rdquo; A very expensive
      building, in fact, such as best comported with his dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      For Mr. Bigelow was a rising man; and the simple inscription on the
      ground-glass door, &ldquo;G. Hyde Bigelow &amp; Company,&rdquo; already stood in the
      eyes of a small quarter of the financial world of Chicago for unqualified
      success. If a syndicate was to be floated, if a mysterious new combine was
      to be organized, what so important to its success as the name of G. Hyde
      Bigelow somewhere behind the venture&mdash;what so necessary in the
      somewhat difficult task of making it plain that paper is gold, that water
      is a solid, as the indorsement of G. Hyde Bigelow &amp; Company? If
      Bigelow invested largely in Kentucky coal lands, what more reasonable than
      an immediate boom in Kentucky coal&mdash;and that men should speak sagely
      on the street of the immense value of the new mines? If Bigelow went
      heavily into the new-style freighters that were to revolutionize the
      lake-carrying trade, what more natural than a rush in &ldquo;new freighters,&rdquo;
       and who could know if the Bigelows should unload rapidly on an inflated
      market? But the great man is speaking!
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him, on the mahogany desk, were spread some papers&mdash;vastly
      important papers, or they could never have penetrated to the Presence to
      take up time of such inestimable value. &ldquo;Time is money&rdquo; is a phrase that
      had been heard to fall from the Bigelow lips. Perhaps some one else had
      coined this phrase years before; perhaps Mr. Bigelow himself might even
      vaguely remember hearing it: what matters it! Did not old phrases fall
      new-minted from his lips? Did not the minor earths and moons and
      satellites that revolved about the Bigelow sun recognize in each
      authoritative Bigelow utterance an addition to the language? And were
      there ever such jokes as the Bigelow jokes?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before him were the papers; beside him, in a broad-armed, leather-backed
      mahogany chair, sat the junior partner, the &ldquo;Company&rdquo; of Bigelow &amp;
      Company, Mr. William H. Babcock. A youngish man was Mr. Babcock; a very
      well dressed man with a shrewd, somewhat incredulous eye; a man who speaks
      cautiously, is even inclined to mumble in a low voice; and who finds his
      worth and caution recognized as a useful, if secondary, part of the
      importance of Bigelow &amp; Company. Lacking in the audacious qualities of
      his senior, it would seem, but shrewd, very shrewd&mdash;not a man given
      to unnecessary promises or straight-out declarations. And if Mr. Babcock
      had a phrase, a creed, locked securely away in the depths behind that
      quiet face, it was &ldquo;Business is Business.&rdquo; Business <i>was</i> business to
      Mr. Babcock; and he had hopes, even a fair prospect, indeed, of himself
      rising to a point where Time should be Money, thanks to the aid of the
      Bigelow name. And in the part of those depths where the thinking was done,
      the thought lurked, that if the time should ever come when
      Business-is-Business and Time-is-Money should be combined in his career
      (and everything about him tended to combination), Chicago would be too
      small for William H. Babcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      The papers were before Mr. Bigelow, and the great brain was grappling with
      them; it being Mr. Babcock's part to weed out details and trouble Mr.
      Bigelow only with the broader facts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now, Mr. Babcock,&rdquo; said the head of the firm, &ldquo;how are we to arrive
      at this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock leaned forward and mumbled a few sentences with the air of a
      man habitually afraid of being overheard and caught. Mr. Bigelow's brow
      drew together, in such a state of concentration was the massive brain.
      History has not recorded the subject of these documents; whether it was
      Kentucky Coal or New Freighters, or the booming town of Northwest Chicago,
      or suburban street-railways, or one of the dozen or more growing interests
      that absorbed at this time the attention and some of the money of G. Hyde
      Bigelow &amp; Company (to say nothing of the money of the Bigelow
      followers), we may never know. For at the moment when the Bigelow brows
      were knitted the closest, when the questions raised by the papers were
      about to attain a masterly and decisive solution, an office-boy entered
      the room&mdash;a round-eyed boy so awed by the Presence that he was
      visibly impatient to deliver his message and efface himself&mdash;a boy
      who was habitually out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady t' see y'u, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow turned with some annoyance. How often had his subordinates
      instructed this boy to demand the card of every visitor and to lay it
      silently on the mahogany desk. But, on the other hand, Mr. Bigelow made it
      a point to rise above petty annoyances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, boy, what is the name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh' wouldn' give 't, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The great man's expression changed slightly; it was as if he had suddenly
      remembered something. He turned to the desk and fingered the papers for a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We will take up this matter after lunch, Mr. Babcock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He spoke a shade more pompously than was his wont in dealing with his
      junior.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock bowed and went out. Then Mr. Bigelow turned to his
      stenographer, who was clicking away by the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Brown, I wish you would go out to the files and look up all the Pine
      Lands correspondence for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stenographer laid aside her work and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now Mr. Bigelow, once more bland and gracious, turned to the boy who
      was holding fast to the bronze door-knob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, boy, you may show the lady in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Having said this, he bent over a letter and was so busy that he seemed not
      to hear the woman enter. For some moments she stood there by the closed
      door. Once she coughed timidly; and even that failed to reach the
      attention of the much-absorbed man. But at last the letter was laid down
      and Mr. Bigelow turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; he said, motioning to the chair that Mr. Babcock had just now
      vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the woman, it seemed, preferred to stand. &ldquo;Why have you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know why I have come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow took up the letter again and regarded it closely. A great many
      thoughts apparently were passing through his mind&mdash;thoughts not of
      Kentucky Coal and New Freighters, but of a stately suburban home of
      granite completed within the year; of a certain Mrs. Bigelow who was
      rising rapidly toward the social leadership of her suburb, and was
      carrying Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow into circles that he, with all his prestige
      of a sort, could hardly have penetrated alone; of a certain dignified,
      comfortable, downright conservative suburban church, where the Bigelow
      money and judgment, new as they were in such surroundings, were
      undoubtedly earning a place; and, lastly, of certain small Bigelows. Of
      all these things thought Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said at length, without raising his eyes, &ldquo;what is it now? What
      do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I had only myself to think of,&rdquo; began the woman, speaking in a low
      voice and with noticeable effort, &ldquo;I should never come near you. But I <i>have</i>
      others to think of, and I think you have, too. I have not come for money.
      If I could do it, I should like to bring every cent you have given me and
      throw it in your face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather unpleasant words these&mdash;unpleasant to Mr. Bigelow, at least.
      Indeed, they seemed quite to disturb him, to drive him even toward
      something that in a man of smaller reputation might have been called
      brutality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he burst out, wheeling around, &ldquo;how long is this going to keep
      up? How many years more must I support you in idleness? There is a limit
      to this sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It may be that this was not so much brutality as sagacity. It may be that
      Mr. Bigelow had in mind certain steps that might relieve him from a
      situation which was growing more and more annoying and disagreeable, and
      that this was one of the steps. For such words as these&mdash;such a blaze
      of righteous anger&mdash;should be very hard to answer in a man's own
      office; hard at least for an unknown woman before the great G. Hyde
      Bigelow. Even if the woman had come with vague notions that she was acting
      within her rights, that the law which had severed her life from the life
      of this man so long ago would support her now&mdash;what was she, after
      all, but an unfortunate woman standing before a great man?
    </p>
    <p>
      But there was a curious expression in her eyes: perhaps she was more
      resolute than he supposed; perhaps simply she had reached a point in
      wretchedness where such words fail of an impression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told you I should never come to your office, I did not know how
      you would take advantage of me. I should not have come even now if I could
      have helped it. I don't know if it will interest you to hear that I have
      not had enough to eat this week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was mistaken; Mr. Bigelow was interested. Indeed, he was beginning to
      recover himself and to look down on the ill-dressed woman before him from
      the proper altitude of G. Hyde Bigelow. As he looked down he told himself
      that he was quite calm, that he was standing frankly and firmly, as became
      him, on his proper footing as a prominent citizen. And such a sight as
      this, an ill-dressed woman standing in this mahogany office and talking
      about starvation, was really shocking. He felt that he must dismiss her,
      must rid himself of her; but on the other hand he was really touched by
      her distress. Mr. Bigelow leaned back in his chair and half closed his
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long has this been going on?&rdquo; he asked, in a voice that showed signs
      of leading up to something further.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave him a puzzled, indignant flash of her eyes and replied in the
      same low voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is more than fourteen years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      More than fourteen years&mdash;think of it! For fourteen years this woman
      had been suffering for an error of judgment, the mistake of two deluded
      years, the mistake of giving her life to the wrong man, and now had even
      faced starvation because of it. So mistakes are punished in this world.
      Mr. Bigelow, on his part, looking down from his great altitude, was
      running over these fourteen years and recalling the mistakes of his own
      that had brought this annoying visit upon him. He had been soft-hearted;
      he saw it plainly enough now. In his effort to do right, to comply
      voluntarily with certain nominal requirements which a less honourable man
      would have easily evaded; in his effort to be kind to a foolish young
      woman&mdash;and a very young woman indeed she had been at first&mdash;to
      humour her childish notions of the facts of this real world&mdash;his
      impulses had carried him too far, and she, of course, had taken advantage
      of him. He should have known better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hum! More than fourteen years,&rdquo; he repeated, still sitting in his chair
      and looking dreamily at a group picture of a certain Board of Directors
      that hung above his desk. &ldquo;Has it ever occurred to you to stop and figure
      up how much you have cost me during these years&mdash;how many times I
      have sent you large sums without a word? If you will think of it now you
      will remember that I have asked no questions&mdash;that I have known
      nothing whatever about your life and your acquaintances. I have not known
      how real your needs were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He might have gone on to much plainer speaking, even to harshness (it
      being necessary sometimes in dealing with such people), had not his
      half-shut eyes strayed downward from the Board of Directors to her face.
      What he saw there seemed to weaken his self-possession. And, for another
      thing, it was certainly getting time for his stenographer to be returning
      with the Pine Lands correspondence. It was really a rather awkward moment
      for Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said abruptly, opening his eyes again, &ldquo;there is no use in
      prolonging this conversation. Tell me what you have come here for and be
      done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was so abrupt that she had to wait a moment and compose herself before
      beginning in the same low tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I had not come for money, and I meant it. I am tired of
      begging for my living. But it would cost you very little to help me to
      some situation. If you will do this, I will try not to trouble you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow pressed his lips and beat a tattoo with his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What kind of work can you do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't take skilled work, I suppose,&rdquo; she replied a little wearily,
      &ldquo;and I could hardly expect an office position&mdash;at my age. But I have
      thought of going into a department store. I really ought to be able to do
      something there.&rdquo; Mr. Bigelow was fidgeting a little: he was thinking of
      the Pine Lands correspondence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don't know but what that could be arranged. I will
      speak to Murray of the New York store. He is employing hundreds of people
      all the time, and I know he has difficulty in getting good ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He finished with a wave of dismissal and turned back to his letter. But
      the woman waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will see him to-day?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes&rdquo;&mdash;rather impatiently&mdash;&ldquo;I will try to see him this
      noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And shall I come back this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow leaned back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hardly think that will be necessary. Let me see&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how I am to know if I don't come back&mdash;unless you write
      to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated at this and, thanks to his hesitation, received a keen stroke
      below his armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is the writing,&rdquo; she said, with quiet, bitter scorn, &ldquo;you know I
      have letters enough now.&rdquo; Yes, she had, and he knew it: there had been
      blue moments in his life when he would have given a great deal to get
      those letters back&mdash;letters relating to money matters, most of them;
      explanations why certain sums were still unpaid, perhaps; letters sent
      back into another life, a life which had gone under Mr. Bigelow's feet as
      he mounted to higher things. And she added: &ldquo;You needn't sign your name,
      if you'd rather not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, it was time to close this interview. He was not enjoying it at all&mdash;was
      even willing to concede a point in order to be rid of her. So he said
      shortly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I will see him at noon and let you know by the morning
      delivery if he has a place for you.&rdquo; She turned to go but he detained her.
      &ldquo;Here&mdash;wait! I will tell him that you are a cousin of mine. Do you
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no reply to this, but simply went out as swiftly and silently as
      possible. She was evidently as glad as he to be through with it. And Mr.
      Bigelow, after glancing at the Pine Lands correspondence and after a look
      at his watch, put on his hat and coat and left the office. It was not yet
      his lunch time, but when bent upon a benevolent errand Mr. Bigelow would
      hear of no delay; and recalling that Mr. Murray was usually on the point
      of leaving the club when he entered, he was willing even to hasten his
      lunch in order to make sure of a chat with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And chat they did, those two powerful, public-spirited ones, over their
      cigars, of the questions of the day, handled as only masters of commerce
      could handle them; until at length&mdash;this from Mr. Bigelow, lighting a
      fresh cigar and speaking casually over his hollowed hands:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Murray, I have a cousin who is in a bad way&mdash;husband
      dead, and some children, and that sort of thing. I want to do a little
      something for her if I can. Could you give her any work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid the best place I could offer would be behind the counter in my
      North Side store at three dollars a week or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd be grateful for anything. It's a matter of keeping alive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Murray was always glad of an opportunity to oblige Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Send her around, with a letter, and I will do the best I can for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And thus did Mr. Bigelow free himself from an entangling alliance. He had
      now given the woman an opportunity to prove her worth; if after this she
      should stumble into dark ways, there would be only herself to blame. It
      had cost him considerable effort, to say nothing of his time; but had it
      not been worth while?

      CHAPTER II&mdash;Low Life
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>ear Mr. Halloran:
      Won't you come down to the Settlement Friday evening? The young men's
      class and the girls' class are going to entertain themselves, and Mr.
      Appleton Le Duc has promised to help them. I want to have another talk
      with you about George. We have heard nothing from him for a week, and I am
      afraid he is in trouble. After such encouragement as he has given us I
      don't like to let go of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be sure to come if you can.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sincerely yours,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret Davies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The above note accounts for the presence of Halloran and Le Duc (he of the
      nimble legs) in a suburban train, on that Friday evening, bound for
      Clybourn and the Settlement. A few seats behind them sat Miss Davies,
      escorted by Mr. Babcock, a young business man who seemed to be going in
      heartily for charity work at this time. Le Duc was talking earnestly with
      Halloran. Apparently a momentous question had arisen in his life, and the
      young man beside him, who had had plenty of experience in earning his own
      living, who could steer a life-boat in a boiling sea, whose generalship
      alone, it was conceded by one party in college, had won the Chicago game
      that fall, was, he felt sure, the best counselor to be found in the
      difficult task of guiding a life straight toward its destiny.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know another fellow I could come to with a question like this,
      Jack; but you understand these things; you know life. You've learned
      things already that the rest of us spend the most of our lives finding
      out. Now what would you say&mdash;how far do you think a man ought to go
      in sticking to the idea of an education?&rdquo; Le Due's &ldquo;education,&rdquo; for
      several years now, had consisted of the study of elocution, with an
      occasional peck at English Literature or the French language, and a few, a
      very few, disastrous examinations. &ldquo;I've got an offer to quit college
      right now to go in as second comedian with the Pooh Bah Company. They
      offer thirty dollars a week to begin with, with every prospect for a
      future. It is a rising company, you see&mdash;a sure thing. They are as
      safe as the First National Bank. If that were just the work I wanted, I
      couldn't do better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran was sitting back with his hat down on his forehead, listening
      conscientiously, but losing a word now and then, thanks to the roar of the
      train.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, old chap, I set my mind on Shakespeare when I first came to
      college. I decided then it would be Shakespeare or nothing with me. A
      man's got to have a goal, you know; he's got to aim high or he will never
      get anywhere; and my goal has been Shakespeare. But the question is just
      this: Ought I to give up this offer, when it may be my chance to get a
      good start on the stage? I might be able to work up into Shakespeare by
      keeping at this for awhile, and making a professional acquaintance, and
      saving up money. Men have done it, you know. What do you say?&rdquo; He
      evidently really expected an answer, so Halloran gave it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid you'll have to decide that for yourself, Apples. If you care
      enough for first-class work to stick it out in college and then take your
      chances, you ought to do it: if you don't, take this. That's all I can
      say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With which casual conversation did an evening begin that later promised to
      influence considerably the lives of several members of the party.
    </p>
    <p>
      They found a crowd of ragged boys and girls at the Settlement. Le Duc was
      to &ldquo;read&rdquo; for them; but he found himself fairly eclipsed by the
      performances of two of their own number, one a youthful dancer with a
      wizened face and remarkably thin legs, named Jimmie McGinnis, the other a
      dark-eyed girl, one Lizzie Bigelow, who sang some popular songs in a
      really good natural voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      This girl made an immediate impression on Apples. At the close of her
      first song he stopped applauding long enough to say confidentially to
      Halloran, &ldquo;Remarkable what a lot of talent you find among these people.
      That girl ought to be in the profession. Really a stunning girl&mdash;and
      clever, awfully clever. Splendid! Splendid!&rdquo; he exclaimed again, turning
      toward her as she came into the hall, and applauding vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      She laughed and shook her head, but made no reply. She evidently liked
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have studied&mdash;to sing like that,&rdquo; Le Duc went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      She flushed with pleasure, but only shook her head again and sat down on
      the stairs to listen to the next recitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Le Duc stepped out, bowing with his easy, good-natured smile, Miss
      Davies saw her opportunity to speak to Halloran. At the beginning of the
      evening she had talked a moment with Lizzie Bigelow, but with
      unsatisfactory results as her troubled expression showed. She now led the
      way to a sitting-room behind the stairs. For a short space they were
      silent&mdash;this young woman who, with the buoyancy of youth, with
      sanguineness hardly justified by the facts of the black city that was
      pulsing around her, had plunged into its darkness the feeble light of her
      hopes&mdash;and this young man who knew so well the difficulty of climbing
      up from sloth and incompetency and vicious ignorance that he was willing
      to help. He put his hands in his pockets and stood waiting for her to
      begin. He liked to look at her, she was so earnest and unconscious of
      herself; perhaps, too, because she was well worth looking at, with her
      clear, delicate skin now a little flushed and the masses of brown hair
      above her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote you,&rdquo; she began, &ldquo;that we have lost track of George. He was here
      as usual a week ago Wednesday, but then he disappeared. Lizzie, his
      sister, says they have no idea where he is; and I don't think she cares
      very much. She says he can look out for himself, and that is more than
      they can do for him at home. Now what are we to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen his mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not yet. She always rebuffs me. If she were more like our other
      women it would be easier. I wanted to talk with you first, and see if we
      couldn't think of some way to find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have no clue. She might be able to give us a hint. Even to learn
      something about his loafing places would be a start&mdash;something to
      work from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose&mdash;if she would tell. She is proud, you know. But we must do
      something. I can't leave that boy wandering around the city like this. The
      first thing we will hear of him in jail, and after that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       She ended with a shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a thought that entered his mind Halloran smiled slightly. &ldquo;Have you
      talked with Jimmie?&rdquo; he asked. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jimmie McGinnis?&rdquo; She had to smile, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He might tell something. One always knows what the other is up to. I
      can't think of any other way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked earnestly at him as she asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you try it&mdash;if I bring him here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded, and soon she returned with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie looked from one to the other, his small eyes devoid of expression,
      his inscrutable thin face as innocent as that of a sleeping baby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Jimmie,&rdquo; said Halloran, &ldquo;Miss Davies and I want to talk with
      you about George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie seated himself and waited respectfully, his thin legs dangling off
      the floor, his hands clasped meekly in his lap. He was always willing to
      be talked to&mdash;rather enjoyed it, in fact&mdash;was particularly fond
      of moral lectures; had a keen little mind somewhere behind his narrow
      forehead, and could bring himself to discuss moral questions with his lady
      teachers, showing all the symptoms of an eager water-lily striving upward
      from its dark bed toward the light of day. Miss Davies he understood
      perfectly and really liked, in a way. She was good&mdash;and why not? Who
      wouldn't be good with plenty to eat and wear, with fathers and mothers,
      and grand suburban homes with real trees about them (he had been taken out
      there once for some Fresh Air, on which occasion he had seen a cow for the
      first time in his life). But he was a little afraid of Halloran, and
      inclined to grow secretive in his presence. To sum him up, Jimmie was
      already launched upon a professional career&mdash;he sold score-cards at
      the baseball park&mdash;and he fully realized the importance of his place
      in life; even hoped some day to be a manager and walk out to the players'
      bench before the game in a checked suit, announce the battery of the day,
      and toss out the new ball from a capacious pocket, a new ball in a red box
      with a white seal around it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Jimmie, do you know where he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir. I heard some one say he hadn't been around for a week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran threw a quick glance at Miss Davies; but it was not too quick for
      Jimmie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has run off, Jimmie, and we want to find him. It don't make any
      difference why he went. Anybody's likely to get into trouble now and then;
      and I'm not going to ask any questions. But if he has lost his job or got
      into trouble I think we could help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0004" id="linkimage-0004"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0051.jpg" alt="0051 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0051.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, I'm sure you could,&rdquo; Jimmie replied gratefully; and what little
      expression there was in his face said plainly enough, &ldquo;Don't I know how
      you have helped me?&rdquo; And then he added in eagerness to assist, &ldquo;I could
      stop at the box-factory, if you like, and see if he ain't working any
      more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I wish you would. Tell us about it Monday at class. That's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Jimmie got soberly down from the chair and went out, leaving Miss
      Davies and Halloran to look at each other expressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think?&rdquo; said she.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is going straight to warn him. Something is the matter. We must try
      his mother now. And we ought to do it quickly&mdash;before Monday.&rdquo; Miss
      Davies mused for a moment. &ldquo;We could hardly get there to-night&mdash;we
      might go to-morrow afternoon, when she gets back from her work. I will
      arrange to have dinner here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran nodded; and they returned to the hall. Jimmie was dancing again
      when they reached the parlour door, to music by one of the resident
      teachers who had volunteered to take the place of Miss Davies. Apples had
      disappeared and Lizzie Bigelow also. Miss Davies looked around for them;
      then, realizing after a moment that Jimmie's feet were not the only ones
      that were stepping in time to the music, she glanced up the stairway. A
      laugh from the upper hall and the fling of a skirt at the head of the
      stairs brought a puzzled expression to her face. But the explanation came
      in a moment. Just as Jimmie stopped dancing and was turning toward the
      hall, Apples came running down the stairs, a cane in his hand, and after
      him Lizzie Bigelow, laughing, nearly breathless, and with a heightened
      colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Miss Davies,&rdquo; Apples exclaimed with all his good-natured assurance on
      the surface, &ldquo;Miss Bigelow and I are going to do a cake-walk, and we want
      you to play for us&mdash;a good, lively march, with a lot of jump in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Miss Davies looked at him surprised, then at Lizzie; finally, in distress,
      she turned to Halloran. But he found nothing to say. Before Miss Davies
      could collect her wits and think of some excuse Apples was blundering on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Play the one you did for the boy&mdash;that'll do splendidly. We've been
      practising up-stairs, and it goes mighty well. We'd better do it now,
      before we get our steps mixed. Miss Bigelow says she'd rather do this than
      the song she is down to sing&mdash;didn't you?&rdquo; he added, appealing to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She assented rather shamefacedly, and Miss Davies gave up. There was no
      rule against cakewalks, and she herself had invited Le Duc to entertain
      the boys and girls; so she concealed her dislike for this juvenile way of
      overstepping boundaries and went to the piano. Halloran was downright
      sorry for her, but he did not see what he could do..

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III&mdash;George and His Troubles
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>alloran foresaw
      that it might be late Saturday evening before Miss Davies and he could
      return to Evanston, so he arranged with another member of the crew to
      stand his watch from ten to midnight; and then, knowing nothing of what
      might be before them, these two young people set out on their search for
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      Picture a tenement far out on the North Side, one of thousands of
      smoke-coloured buildings, somewhere on an obscure street that was
      discouragingly like dozens of other streets. Without the tenement an
      electric light (for it was six o'clock and dark on this autumn day) threw
      its flare on an uneven cedar-block pavement, worn into ruts and holes that
      had given up, hopeless of repair, to mud and filth; on obscure little
      tailor shops and masquerade-costume shops, and dirty tobacco shops with
      windows hung full of questionable prints; on an itinerant
      popcorn-and-peanut man, who had stationed his glass-enclosed cart on the
      corner and was himself sitting on the curbstone, the picture of disgust
      with life; on a prosperous red-brick corner building, that shed light and
      comfort from half a dozen broad windows, announcing itself by its
      curtained inner door and its black-and-gilt signs to be Hoffman's sample
      room. So much for the neighbourhood. Within the tenement, up three flights
      of stairs, was an apartment of two rooms where lived Mrs. Craig with her
      daughter and her son, who bore the name of Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie was sewing: her mother, back home for supper in the intermission
      between the work of afternoon and evening, was taking off her hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the fire going, Lizzie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head without looking up. &ldquo;How did I know you were
      coming home so early?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is six o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how do you suppose I'm ever going to get my work done if I have to
      make fires for you? Where's George, I'd like to know! That's his business,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Craig, herself wondering where George was, went to the next room and
      built the fire herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few moments later Halloran knocked at the door, and Miss Davies and he
      were admitted. And while Miss Davies was opening the subject, trying with
      the utmost delicacy to obtain the confidence of this woman, trying to show
      by simple, honest words how sincerely she and Halloran were interested in
      George, another boy, a small, wizened-faced boy with thin legs, was hiding
      in a doorway across the street, watching with keen little eyes for their
      exit and pondering with a keen little mind on their probably next move.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Davies was beginning to wonder if she had not overestimated the
      difficulty of talking with Mrs. Craig. Or was it the present topic that
      made it a little easier? For she had come now with no offers of food, or
      coal for the fires; but only to talk about George, to see if she and the
      young man with her might not, by giving their time and interest, make the
      search easier. And the main difficulty seemed now to be that the woman
      knew no more about it than they did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was early last week,&rdquo; she explained, speaking quietly, in a voice that
      had been brought to a dead level by habitual restraint. &ldquo;He went off to
      work as usual, after dinner, and said he would be back to supper. I don't
      know where he can be. He has never been a bad boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lizzie, now that so much trouble was going on about George, began to feel
      unusually sorrowful herself&mdash;was even moved to tears, and had to go
      into the other room and bustle about getting supper ready before she could
      bring her feelings under control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Halloran thought the best thing would be to go out and search for
      him,&rdquo; said Miss Davies. &ldquo;And he thought you could help&mdash;:&mdash;&rdquo; She
      turned to him and finished by saying, &ldquo;Won't you explain to Mrs. Craig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you tell us,&rdquo; he responded, &ldquo;of some place in the neighbourhood that
      George has been in the habit of going to&mdash;some place where he has
      friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Craig shook her head. &ldquo;No; when he was not working he was almost
      always at home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he surely had acquaintances. You see, Mrs. Craig, we must have some
      place to start from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She thought for a moment. &ldquo;No; so far as I know, there was only one man in
      the neighbourhood who took the least interest in him. And he wouldn't know
      anything about this. We have not lived here so very long&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Hoffman, on the corner. He has been kind to George, once or twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran rose, saying aside to Miss Davies, &ldquo;I will speak to him and come
      back here,&rdquo; and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found a stout German behind the bar in the corner saloon who proved,
      upon inquiry, to be Hoffman himself. He was a substantial sort of man,
      speaking excellent English, and representing, if one could judge from the
      neat, well-stocked bar, the clean floor, the geraniums in the windows, and
      the general air of thrift and order, what he might have been pleased to
      call a decent saloon. Halloran began without preliminary by asking Hoffman
      if he knew George Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The saloon-keeper rested both hands on the bar and looked across it,
      scrutinizing him closely before answering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, there is a boy of that name around here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He disappeared from home last week and his family are worried about him.
      I have been told that you might help me find him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hoffman shook his head, still watching him closely. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I know
      nothing about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he been about here at all lately?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it is two weeks since I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The honest German face had the word suspicion plainly written on it,
      Halloran saw that he was not getting at the man at all, so he leaned on
      the bar and explained himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come from the University Settlement. George has been at class
      there regularly until lately. His teachers believe in him and want to help
      him. They are afraid now that he has got into trouble and is afraid to
      come back. Do you know anything about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For reply Hoffman asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You come from the Settlement?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen Mrs. Craig?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just come from there. Miss Davies, George's teacher, is with her
      now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The big man slowly turned it over in his mind. Finally he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all I know, but it is not very much. There is another
      little boy named McGinnis who is around with him most of the time. The
      McGinnis boy worked at the ball park until the season closed last week.
      For ten days now he has been coming here for a glass of beer pretty often,
      and he always carries away the lunch. You say you want to help George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I will tell you what I think.&rdquo; He used the word &ldquo;think,&rdquo; but his
      expression showed that he knew pretty nearly the facts. &ldquo;McGinnis has an
      uncle, a boat-builder, who has a place under the Wells Street Bridge. You
      go down there and you will learn more than I can tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran thanked him and returned to Miss Davies, Mrs. Craig, he found,
      was getting ready to go back to work. They were all waiting anxiously for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we are started right,&rdquo; he said cheerily, addressing the mother.
      &ldquo;I will be back later in the evening and report progress.&rdquo; To Miss Davies
      he said: &ldquo;You would rather wait at the Settlement, I suppose. I shan't be
      back probably before eight or nine o'clock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she said in a low voice as they were passing out the door, &ldquo;don't
      you want me to go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am afraid not. I could hardly take you prowling around the wharves at
      night.&rdquo; And he told her, as they went down the stairs behind Mrs. Craig,
      what directions the saloon-keeper had given him. They were still talking
      about it when they joined the woman on the sidewalk; and then the three of
      them walked together to the second corner, talking it over and over again.
      For Mrs. Craig was beginning to discover that the young people were
      downright interested in her and in her boy. There was no gracious
      down-reaching here, no lending a kind hand to the unfortunate; but just a
      young woman who believed she could help, and a young man who knew a little
      of what it all meant; in short, here were two real persons who said little
      and meant more. She was not afraid, as she looked at them, that they would
      pray for her, loudly and zealously, kneeling on the floor of her own
      tenement rooms. And she was inclined to wonder, looking out at them across
      her own sea of troubles, what life was to hold for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something of this last thought got into her manner as she took their hands
      at parting; indeed, her reserve so nearly broke that she gave them&mdash;not
      singly, but the two of them together&mdash;a look that brought a faint
      blush to the young woman's cheek and to her mind other thoughts than
      George and his difficulties&mdash;-thoughts that disturbed her a little
      later when she and Halloran were walking toward the Settlement, so foolish
      and trivial were they beside the realities of the scene that had passed&mdash;thoughts
      that were resolutely put from her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the Settlement steps she lingered a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I were going with you,&rdquo; she said, hesitating. &ldquo;There is pride in
      the family, and George has his share of it. If you&mdash;if he should
      think you blamed him or looked down on him, he would never come back with
      you. He has always been hard to reach, and I think it is because of a
      rough sort of sensitiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Was it unreasonable that she should wish to continue handling this case,
      just now when tact was so urgently needed? Or that she should give
      Halloran a hint of the best course to take with the boy?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't blame him,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;The way to help him is to make him feel
      like somebody. If you once let him get to thinking that he is good for
      nothing he'll run down hill fast. Jimmie McGinnis, now, will take all the
      knocks you can give him, and go right on turning his pennies; he will be
      in the City Council yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded, for she saw that he understood. And he turned away to begin
      the search, walking over to the car-line. As he sat down in the first
      trailer a small boy ran alongside the rear car and swung himself aboard,
      hurriedly drawing in a pair of thin legs after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through gloomy Kinzie Street walked Halloran, when he had reached the
      river district, and after him, half a block or more, came the thin legs.
      He got to the bridge by the Northwestern Station, crossed over, and looked
      around for a means of descent to the wharves. After a moment he saw in the
      shadow of a brick building&mdash;a building that was a South Water Street
      market in front, a factory in the upper half and a tug-office behind&mdash;what
      seemed to be a break in the railing. He crossed to it and found, sure
      enough, a narrow stairway, covered with mud and slime, leading down toward
      the oily surface of the river. It was curious&mdash;he had crossed the
      bridge a hundred times, but it had never occurred to him that there was
      any life below the street, that men came and went down there on the strip
      of wharf, so narrow that it seemed little more than a fender for the
      buildings that backed on the river. Picking his way carefully to avoid
      slipping, he walked down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not far away, in the basement of one of these buildings, was a sailors'
      grog-shop: hardly three rods from the bridge-walk, even in sight from it,
      yet so quietly tucked away below story on story of brick building, behind
      half a dozen smoking tugs, in a spot where no sober doorway, no saloon
      doorway even, had a right to be&mdash;so hidden, in fact, that not half a
      dozen of the tens of thousands of people on the bridge daily had ever
      observed it. It was a wonder how a drunken man could ever get out through
      the door without falling into the river&mdash;perhaps one did fall now and
      then. There was music in the saloon now&mdash;a squeaking fiddle and loud
      noises.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond, the river was splashed with red and white and green from lanterns
      and side-lights; and a dozen masts, their spars and rigging apparently
      interlaced, were outlined against the western sky. At the moment a big
      freighter, bound out, was headed for the draw, forging slowly and almost
      silently down the sluggish stream, passing along like some dim modern
      Flying Dutchman. Above, on the bridge, cars were rumbling and footsteps
      were pattering&mdash;the feet of the late suburbanites hurrying to their
      trains. All Chicago was alive and bustling above him and around him; but
      here, at the end of a crooked passage, was a quiet spot&mdash;a shop
      filled with boats, completed and uncompleted; and sprawled on his stomach
      behind one of the boats, a cigarette in his mouth, an Old Sleuth story
      spread on the boards before him, a candle stuck in a beer bottle at his
      elbow, was a boy, who was trying to believe that he was, in spite of cold
      feet and sniffling nose, really tough and comfortable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, George,&rdquo; said Halloran, &ldquo;how's business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George started, turned pale, and hastily took the cigarette from his
      mouth; then remembering his independence, he as hastily put it back.
      Halloran sat down on the stem of a ship's boat and filled his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Davies and I heard you were in hard luck,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;and I
      thought I'd look you up and see what's the matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George had not been able to speak until now. He sat up, pulled doggedly a
      moment at his cigarette, and said in a very sulky tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you I was here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran would have been glad to answer him, but as it fell out no reply
      was necessary. For just as he was pausing to light his pipe a step was
      heard in the passage and a wizened-faced boy appeared in the outer circle
      of the candle-light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Jimmie, eyeing Halloran with distrust, glancing apologetically at
      George, more disturbed, in fact, than Halloran had yet seen him. To him
      now George turned a reproachful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never done it, George,&rdquo; said Jimmie. &ldquo;I'd a-busted first. He went
      around to old Hoffman and he put him onto my uncle. I see him go in there
      and I followed him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, George,&rdquo; Halloran put in by way of seconding Jimmie. &ldquo;We
      couldn't get a word out of him. It was your mother that sent me to
      Hoffman. But I've come down to talk with you, and I'm not sorry that
      Jimmie is here. Now, what's the trouble? Tell me about it; and then I will
      see what we can do for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two boys looked at each other. George had been told so often by
      certain Settlement workers never to smoke, never to read bad books, never
      to be seen in company with beer bottles, he had supposed that of course
      these things would be the first subjects under discussion; and the
      omission disconcerted him. Jimmie, meanwhile, being the shrewder of the
      two, was signaling him to go ahead and spit it out. So he began, in a
      blundering, sullen sort of a way; stumbled, blushed and stopped. Finally
      Jimmie had to take it up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it's just this way. George's folks was getting down pretty close
      to the boards, and they was the rent coming, and George he had his week's
      pay, but it wasn't enough, so I just told him&rdquo;&mdash;very patronizing
      here, was Jimmie, as became a young capitalist who had once clasped the
      hand of Captain Anson&mdash;&ldquo;I told him to give it to me and I'd put it up
      on the Washington game, with a little wad of my own. It was an easy mark,
      'cause the Washingtons were tail-enders, and I had hold of their mascot,
      and he was willing to put up even. It was like taking the money out of his
      pocket, but a man can't throw away a chance like that&mdash;and then I'll
      be damned if Billy Connors didn't up and throw the game.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a hell of a pitcher,&rdquo; was George's comment, spoken with a sidelong
      glance at Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind,&rdquo; said Jimmie, &ldquo;Watson 'll never sign him again, after a
      trick like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Rather an interesting situation this&mdash;an odd confusing of good
      motives with bad&mdash;an amusing symptom of good feeling in speculator
      Jimmie, to be taking up the support of a young man who had been ruined
      through his advice. He would doubtless get over it as he grew older. If
      every man were to feel the same responsibility, what a wreck it would make
      of our institutions! What a scrambling there would be in Wall Street, in
      La Salle Street! Incipient socialism this&mdash;a bad thing, very bad!
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran nodded and smiled a little. &ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We're all of us
      likely to fall down now and then. I don't know as I should have done just
      that, though. A man can't afford to gamble unless he can afford to lose;
      and there aren't many such men. I'm not sure there are any.&rdquo; He smiled
      again&mdash;he knew just how George felt, just about what he was thinking
      behind that clouded face. &ldquo;But now the question is, how are we going to
      fix you up again? You can't stay here. How much did you lose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again it was Jimmie that answered, &ldquo;Three fifty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran thought for a moment, doing some sums in his head; then he took a
      purse from his pocket and counted out the money.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, George,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is a loan. I know you're square, and I'm
      willing to take your word for it. There is no hurry; but some day, when
      you feel you can, you may pay it back. We needn't either of us say
      anything about it.&rdquo; George's expression was changing every moment; but he
      took the money. &ldquo;Suppose we go back to the house now, George. You will
      find your mother and sister mighty glad to see you. And Miss Davies is
      waiting at the Settlement to hear about you. She has worried a good deal.
      Then Monday we will see if we can't get the factory to give you another
      trial.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George's armour was not proof against such an attack as this. He got up,
      put the story in his pocket, and lighted Halloran and Jimmie along the
      passage with his candle; then he snuffed it out and put it in his pocket,
      threw the bottle into the river and followed the two others up the
      stairway to the street.

      CHAPTER IV&mdash;The End of the Beginning
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ending over a book
      sat Halloran, both elbows on the table, the fingers of both hands run
      through his hair. The book lay open, and spread out on the leaves was a
      note from Miss Davies; in part this ran as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;. . . George is to have another trial at the box-factory. They seem
      willing to be kind to him, but Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; says
      emphatically that he will not be taken back a second time. But I have
      confidence in him, and particularly in your influence.. . .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you all about it when you next come up to the house. I am
      more grateful than you know&mdash;indeed, we all are&mdash;for your. . .&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had made a discovery. Had he been given to self-scrutiny it would
      have come earlier; and it would then have been a little easier to face.
      But this way of thinking would not help him now; it had not come earlier,
      it was difficult, and the question lay before him: should he make that
      next visit to the house or not?
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up at his nickel alarm-clock and saw that it was time to go on
      watch; so he put on his sweater and oilskins and sou'wester, blew out his
      lamp and walked across the Sheridan road to the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly four years since he had taken care of the Davies's furnace
      and slept in their barn. That had been in his days of &ldquo;subbing&rdquo; for a crew
      position, and he had not been a boy even then; he had entered college at
      twenty-two. Since then, thanks to his salary as a surfman in the pay of
      the Treasury Department, he had got along rather better; he was no longer
      the traditional poor student. He was not ashamed of his struggles, nor
      especially proud of them; he was inclined to think that struggling is not
      in itself particularly commendable; that it is success that counts. He
      knew that Mrs. Davies and her daughter had followed his work with
      interest, and he was grateful for it. &ldquo;Grateful!&rdquo;&mdash;there was the word
      that he stuck at. For, after all, had there not been from the start an
      element of patronage in their kindness to him? &ldquo;Kindness&rdquo; another word
      that hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Number Six was &ldquo;punching&rdquo; the watchman's clock that always hung just
      within the station door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo,&rdquo; he said to Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wet night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, rather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Better keep an eye on that light off the long pier. She's running in
      pretty close, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Number Six disappeared in the dark of the road, bound for bed; and
      Halloran pulled his sweater up around his neck and fell to pacing the
      veranda. The surf was booming on the beach below; the rain was cutting in
      toward the land. Out beyond the breakers were lights&mdash;a line of them
      along the horizon.
    </p>
    <p>
      The time had come to look ahead. In another six months his college course
      would be completed; his playtime would be over; realities lay beyond&mdash;downright
      realities that surround a man, that show clear through him, that bear him
      down and under unless he be made of stronger stuff than they. Wits were
      needed, and judgment; the determination that goes against things, not with
      them. There would be no making up of cuts, out there in the world, no
      special examinations; a man must look higher than the faculty there.
      Mistakes would be hard to rectify, perhaps could never be rectified, where
      a man was already nearer thirty than twenty. He decided not to make that
      next call.

      Wauchung straggled over and between and almost burrowed under a chain of
      sand-hills&mdash;shining yellow hills with tops entirely bald save for a
      spear of rank grass here and there or a dwarfed pine. Outside the mouth of
      the river was Lake Michigan; behind the little city were the pine forests
      of the Lower Peninsula. And the one interesting object of this whole
      region was a man&mdash;for houses and shops were commonplace, streets were
      ill-paved, the railroad was wanting in energy and capital, the inhabitants
      were mostly leveled down to the colourless monotony of the sand-hills&mdash;a
      man named Martin L. Higginson.

    </h5>
    <p>
      There was one imposing building of granite and red bricks on the business
      street&mdash;a glance showed the name of Higginson over the entrance. Two
      large mills stood by the river, surrounded by piles of lumber on the land,
      fronted by rafts of logs in the water, sending out their droning hum all
      day long (and frequently all night long); inside, men were bustling and
      pushing in the effort to keep up with the drive of work outside, the long
      runways were active with men and with moving lumber&mdash;and on each of
      the mills was the name Higginson. Two steamers lay at the Higginson
      wharves&mdash;lake carriers, both, of the Higginson line. A logging
      railroad ran back some twenty miles into the forest; it ran over Higginson
      land to Higginson land, to bring what logs the little river could not
      bring&mdash;for the Higginson property extended far to north, south and
      eastward. There was, in fact, one rich man in the little city&mdash;one
      man who had done what he could to keep the railroad busy, to keep the
      harbour dredged, to keep the streets in better condition, to make Wauchung
      a real city, awake, energetic, proud&mdash;one man who represented
      Wauchung to the outside world: Mr. Higginson.
    </p>
    <p>
      An elderly gentleman he was, a man who had passed the fighting age, who
      would have stopped to rest any time these last six or eight years if the
      business had permitted it; but it had stood until recently that the one
      man in Wauchung who did not take his vacation every year was Mr.
      Higginson. As it often falls out, however, one of his severest misfortunes
      had brought its blessing. For five years and more he had looked for a man,
      for the man, whom he could trust to take up the burden that was beginning
      to weigh so heavily; and for five years he had failed. He liked young
      Crosman, the head clerk in the office; but Crosman, though welcome enough
      at the house as Mamie Higginson's regular caller, hardly showed
      administrative qualities&mdash;his limitations were marked. And so the
      search had gone on: he had tried them, young &ldquo;men and middle-aged men&rdquo;&mdash;and
      he had found that all of them wanted money, and none of them wanted work.
      And what he had to offer was work, little else&mdash;hard work, work for
      head and hands, much thinking of the business, little thinking of self:
      the spirit that would live for the business, that would take its pride in
      the quality of the Higginson work, that would strive, as he had striven,
      to make the name of Higginson a synonym for honest work, work done on
      time, work done a little better than the contract demanded. Where could he
      find a man like this?
    </p>
    <p>
      And then, after five years, through a shipwreck of all occurrences, he had
      found him. He knew him at once, as he had thought he should. Looking down
      from the heights of character and accomplishments, on a world of little
      persons, foolish persons, earnest, weak persons, dishonest persons,
      pompous, empty persons&mdash;all the sorts that go to make up a man's
      world, and nearly all that he is likely to see, unfortunately, from the
      heights&mdash;looking out and down and all about, he had seen a young
      man's head and shoulders climbing up above the rabble. The young man had
      not yet climbed very high; but he was climbing, and that was enough. So
      Mr. Higginson had come to think more lightly of the rheumatism, the
      failing eyes, the many signs of age that had been brought sharply to his
      notice by that shock and exposure on the west coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the time of this chapter, Mr. Higginson and Halloran were seated in the
      office&mdash;Halloran before his desk, Mr. Higginson beside it&mdash;looking
      at a typewritten letter or statement. Twenty-four hours earlier Mr.
      William H. Babcock, of G. Hyde Bigelow &amp; Company, had taken the train
      for Chicago, leaving this document behind him; and now the time had come
      to answer it.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the culmination of a long series of letters and interviews. The
      beginning had been when this same Mr. Babcock had endeavoured to buy the
      Wauchung mills in the interest of Mr. Bigelow. It seemed that Mr. Bigelow
      was about to enter the lumber business. His genius for combination, for
      exploitation, was to be given a new direction. Kentucky Coal, New
      Freighters, Northwest Chicago, all his various interests were prospering,
      thanks to the name of Bigelow, and now the lumber business was to be
      vitalized, to be vivified. Just how it was to be done, or what was to be
      done, was not known; that secret was kept close in the Bigelow office.
      Each newspaper published its own version, to be believed or disbelieved at
      the discretion of the reader. All Mr. Higginson knew was that the Bigelow
      firm could never buy him out, that he had not spent his years in building
      up a business for the benefit of Mr. Bigelow. The business was his life,
      and he meant to keep it for himself and his family and his legitimate
      successors. So the first refusal had been a simple matter&mdash;a plain,
      emphatic no had sufficed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then for a time there had been silence; until one day Halloran learned
      that the Pewaukoe Lumber Company, twenty-odd miles up the shore, had
      succumbed to the blandishments of the low-voiced Mr. Babcock, and had sold
      out mills, standing timber and all. It had not been a prosperous company,
      thanks to the shiftless management of the children of the original owner;
      but there was no reason why it should not do well in good hands. There was
      no question now that, whatever he meant to do next, Mr. Bigelow had a
      footing in the lumber trade, and Halloran had been watching him closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The document on the desk was a statement of the &ldquo;understanding&rdquo; or secret
      agreement that was henceforth to be law among the lumber producers of Lake
      Michigan. It had been presented and accompanied with much confidential
      talk from Mr. Babcock&mdash;all tending to show that the lumbermen, with
      the sole exception of Mr. Higginson, were already united to forward this
      agreement, that the business would be organized as never before, that
      great economies would be brought about in the carrying side of the trade,
      that the strain of competition' would be avoided, that prices would be
      maintained at a somewhat higher figure (a main point, this) under penalty
      of fines, that&mdash;much more low talk and friendly disinterested
      confidences. For their interests were identical, said Mr. Babcock; and
      there was room for them all. Efficiency was the keyword&mdash;efficiency,
      productiveness, economy, identity of interests, good prices. And lastly
      there had been friendly, almost deferential intimations that G. Hyde
      Bigelow &amp; Company held the key to the situation, that the combination
      was already a fact, and that a firm which might decide to stay out must
      take the consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      Simplified, the whole matter came to this: Within the combination,
      prosperity in plenty, but always subject to the guiding judgment of G.
      Hyde Bigelow, hence a certain loss of identity and of control to
      self-respecting heads of companies; without the combination, a fight to a
      finish against the combined power and momentum of Bigelow &amp; Company
      and the &ldquo;Lumber Trust.&rdquo; Just how great was this momentum no one exactly
      knew: but Bigelow was a magic name, no doubt of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have gone over it, have you, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo; said Mr. Higginson.
    </p>
    <p>
      His voice was disturbed and his expression showed worry and trouble. For a
      year Mr. Higginson had been changing, very slightly but none the less
      perceptibly to one as close to him, day after day, as Halloran was. Until
      he had assured himself that his assistant was able to take up the burden,
      he had kept up; but after that moment he had seemed, in a measure, to let
      go. On routine matters he was as strong as ever, but his mind refused to
      work automatically through new problems; there were sometimes gaps in his
      reasoning that he found it difficult to bridge over, and this worried him.
      So it had come about that a tacit agreement existed between the older man
      and the younger, that in questions where vigour was needed, of body or
      mind, the younger man should take the lead; and Mr. Higginson mildly
      deceived himself by giving more attention than formerly to routine matters
      and trivial details. It was Halloran, therefore, who had spent the better
      part of a night thinking out this question, whether to yield or fight. And
      it was Mr. Higginson, naturally enough, who had put the question:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have gone over it, have you, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The Bigelow part of it is what I like least. I am not sure that he
      is just the man you would want to stand responsible for this business, and
      therefore he certainly is not the man to take charge of all the companies
      together&mdash;and that is pretty nearly what this paper means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you think that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he isn't solid. He's been lucky, and just now he's on the top of
      the wave. But his interests and investments are spread out so wide that a
      run of bad luck might upset him. I don't know that it would, but it might.
      And then I have seen a little of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know him personally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I cut his grass for two summers in Evanston, and did odd jobs for
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson pondered, and Halloran went on: &ldquo;On the other hand, his
      resources are large, and if we decide to stand out it may mean a long,
      hard fight. It might be harder than we think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson was still thinking hard, forcing his mind to take up one
      phase of the question after another; and the worried expression, so
      frequently on his face nowadays, was more noticeable than ever. Finally he
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are in favour of declining to join the combination?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the direct question that Halloran had partly foreseen. He
      hesitated, marking at random with a pencil while his thoughts came fast.
      At this moment he saw more clearly than he had seen at any time during the
      night what a refusal would mean. Wealthy as Mr. Higginson was, his wealth
      lay in the lumber lands, the logging railroad, in the mills and the
      steamers, and in Wauchung property; to a certain extent the whole town of
      Wauchung had grown up around Mr. Higginson and was directly or indirectly
      dependent upon him; and all these interests, hanging as they did on the
      lumber business, must suffer when this business was attacked. But he
      caught himself&mdash;if he ran on into this way of thinking he was lost.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied; &ldquo;I think we had better decline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will leave the letter to you,&rdquo; he said; and then went out with a face
      that seemed to express downright-dread. Honest old gentleman, he had
      thought to take a rest; and instead he found himself facing the hardest
      fight of his career.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran took up his pen and made the attitude of Higginson &amp; Company
      plain in three lines.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II&mdash;Under Way
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the parlour of
      the Higginson home, one evening shortly after the incident of the last
      chapter, sat Mrs. Higginson and her daughter, with expressions hardly
      significant of an intense joy in life. In the library, talking earnestly
      behind closed doors, were Mr. Higginson and Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Halloran, what is it?&rdquo; had begun the head of the firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The fight is on. I got the first word of it to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson bowed slightly and waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigelow has cut the price down below cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It took a moment for the older man to grasp the meaning of this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Below cost?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; it's going to be a question of endurance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But we have some large orders on hand. They will keep us busy for awhile.
      How does the Carroll &amp; Condit lumber stand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's about half cut out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can go ahead with it, then, for this week. And after that the
      Michigan City contract will keep us busy for awhile.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Carroll &amp; Condit business is what brought me here to-night. Here
      is a letter from them.&rdquo; Halloran laid it on the table. &ldquo;They offer us a
      chance to meet the new price before they place their order elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Gradually the meaning of Halloran's words had been sinking into Mr.
      Higginson's mind; the relations of cause and effect had been clearing
      before him. He looked the letter over silently, twice, three times.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can hardly believe this&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He saw that this
      was useless talk and he stopped. It had been a verbal order from Carroll,
      a man whom he had reason to hold as the soul of honour; the price had been
      stated and agreed to, precisely as for twenty years back; everything had
      been satisfactory. Good Mr. Higginson had been the victim of a delusion.
      After half a century of struggle he had allowed himself to believe that
      the fight was about over, that his personal achievement meant something;
      that he could stand securely on the heights. He had forgotten that
      Business is Business, that Time is Money and Money Talks; he had forgotten
      that the glorious old world was spinning along, as heedless as ever, after
      the ever-receding glitter, and that there could be no stopping until the
      last great stop should be reached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From what I can gather,&rdquo; said Halloran, &ldquo;they mean to fight us all along
      the line. The Michigan City contract, I think, is good. We have it down in
      black and white, and we can make the delivery in our own steamers; but we
      should have to use the railroads for most of our other orders, and I'm
      afraid we can't do it.&rdquo; He disliked this hammering one trouble after
      another into the old gentleman's aching head, but it had to be done. &ldquo;I'm
      quite sure that Bigelow has influence with the railroads, and of course he
      will use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson was thinking&mdash;thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much&mdash;&rdquo; he was still thinking, desperately raking his facts
      together and facing what seemed like chaos&mdash;&ldquo;how much is this going
      to cost us, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too early to tell. He must show his hand before we can plan our
      game. He's beginning now, and before he gets through, by &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;,
      we'll smash him. We'll make him feel like a whipped coach-dog every time
      he passes a lumber pile.&rdquo; Halloran was getting so excited he had to get up
      and pace the carpet. &ldquo;I know the man; I know his meanness and his vanity.
      I've worked for him, and I've seen him off his guard, and I know his
      insolence. Before we get through with him he'll wish he had gone into a
      bucket-shop, where he belongs, and stayed there, the damned old bloated
      frog of a tin-horn gambler. Let him wreck his Kentucky Coal and his New
      Freighters all he pleases, but he'll get a bellyful if he tries to wreck
      the lumber business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stopped short, looked around at the dark, olive-tinted walls, at the
      stately row of books in their morocco and calf and yellow and red and
      gold; looked at the rich carpet and the restful chairs and at the soft
      light of the polished student-lamp; looked last at Mr. Higginson&mdash;and
      felt a cold sweat breaking out all over his body. What had he said?
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in Halloran's make-up, deep-hidden beneath the laborious years
      of work and study, lay a well, a spouting, roaring geyser of profanity. It
      had come into the world with him; it had been richly fed during his rough,
      knockabout boyhood; and now, in spite of the weights he had put on it, a
      year or two of Michigan lumbermen had been enough to prime it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson was still thinking&mdash;thinking. The facts were before him
      now; at last he had penetrated to them and brought them together. And he
      was facing them&mdash;meeting them squarely without flinching. Quietly he
      sat, one elbow on the green-topped table, his hand shading his eyes; and
      the lamplight fell gently on his head. He was facing the question of
      himself, of his ability to conduct his own business; and another question,
      granting that he was unable, whether he could, in his best judgment, place
      everything he had in the world&mdash;his business, his family, himself&mdash;in
      the hands of this man and bid him Godspeed in his work. So he sat thinking&mdash;thinking;
      and Halloran, a little abashed, but angry still, dropped into a chair and
      waited. At last the old gentleman spoke&mdash;in a low, changed voice.
      &ldquo;Mr. Halloran, I have not been well lately; and I think it best&mdash;to
      tell you that&mdash;for the present the business is in your hands. I will
      stay here and advise with you, but&mdash;I do not wish you to feel
      hampered by my presence in carrying on this fight. I am laying a heavy
      responsibility on you&mdash;but I think&mdash;I trust you will be equal to
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson's part of the fight was over; and he had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higginson was playing clock at the centre-table. She was a wiry
      little woman, capable of great exertion and showing remarkable endurance
      when set on some purpose, such as a shopping trip to Chicago; but
      suffering at other times from languor, and low spirits, and in constant
      need of medical attendance.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had never been able to understand why &ldquo;Mr. H.&rdquo; should insist on
      burying himself in the lumber business, when he was plenty rich enough to
      sell out and take her and her daughter forth from the slumberous quiet of
      Wauchung into the stir of the world. Such stupidity, such meanness of
      ideals (to pass over the injustice to herself&mdash;<i>she</i> was
      nothing; <i>she</i> didn't count) was out of her ken. And in the second
      place, her heart had been set for three seasons on a trip to Hot Springs;
      and even if Mr. H.'s plainness of character were to hold his interests in
      Wauchung in spite of her known desires, he certainly owed it to her to
      give her an outing for a few months. She had borne a great deal for him&mdash;but
      never mind. Doctor Brown would sympathize with her, anyway&mdash;would
      bring her medicine every day if she were but so much as to drop a hint.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mamie had been trying to read a novel; but being herself the meek centre
      of a tremendous little drama, she found it difficult to focus her
      attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma,&rdquo; she said, after a time, &ldquo;don't you think pa looks a little run
      down?&rdquo; This was a euphemism; there was no question that Mr. Higginson was
      looking very bad indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, perhaps,&rdquo; replied her mother. At that moment, the three-o'clock
      pile being prematurely completed, she gave up &ldquo;Clock&rdquo; in disgust and
      shuffled her cards for the thirteen game.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she said, &ldquo;My head has ached hard all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was encouraging. Mamie took up her book again; but not for long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose he is worrying about the business, ma? He and Mr. Halloran
      are working almost every night now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; Mrs. Higginson replied. &ldquo;It would have been better for him
      if he had taken my advice five years ago and retired. Your father has no
      time to think of us, my dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mamie felt some injustice in this and would have dropped the subject had
      not her mother, roused to it, pushed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says himself that Mr. Halloran has shown himself able to run the
      business, and yet he will not go away even for a week. I think if we could
      only get him off for a short time he would want to stay, once he had made
      up his mind to it.&rdquo; At this moment the library door opened and the two men
      could be heard in the hall. Mrs. Higginson's face brightened. &ldquo;Play
      something for me, my dear,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, ma. They are just coming in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who? Are they? Play the march Mr. Halloran likes so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mamie went obediently to the piano and was crashing out the opening chords
      when the two men reached the parlour door. Mrs. Higginson rose and
      extended her hand with a bright smile. Mamie showed signs of stopping, but
      Halloran nodded to her to go on, and dropped into a chair. Mrs. Higginson
      came over and sat down by him, leaving her cards in disorder on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had just asked Mamie to play for me before you came in,&rdquo; she said,
      pitching her voice somewhat above the noise of the march. &ldquo;I always like
      to hear her play when I have one of my headaches. It seems to make me
      forget myself for a little while. And I really think she plays very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes; Halloran thought so, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not one of your cultivated musicians, but I know what I like. And
      that is all anybody can know, I guess. Only most people aren't honest
      enough to say so. I have had a severe headache all day. It was in the back
      of my head, just where I had one last Thursday; and if I hadn't happened
      to have some of the pills left over that Doctor Brown brought for me the
      last time, I don't know what I should have done. One does hate so to give
      up. I have always said to my husband: 'No, Mr. H., I will <i>not</i> give
      up; I will <i>not</i> go to bed and acknowledge myself an invalid. Thank
      goodness I have pride enough left for that.'&rdquo; Here the doorbell claimed
      her attention for a moment. &ldquo;Well, here is Harry Crosman. He is such a
      good boy, we are all so fond of him. And then for a long time&rdquo;&mdash;very
      confidentially, this&mdash;&ldquo;he was really almost the only company there
      was for Mamie, and we were glad to have him drop around on her account.
      The people in Wauchung are so&mdash;so&mdash;well, I'm sure you
      understand. It was pleasant for the dear girl. I don't suppose he is ever
      going to astonish the world, but we are always glad to see him.
      Good-evening, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this greeting the newcomer took a chair, and found himself just in time
      to hear Mrs. Higgin-son, keyed up to extra exertions by the music and the
      company, bring all her artillery to bear on her husband.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Mr. Halloran, I'm just going to appeal to you if Mr. H. isn't
      working too hard. Don't <i>you</i> think it is time he took a little
      vacation&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stopped short, for the long-suffering Mr. H. had turned on her with
      downright impatience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let me hear any more of that talk,&rdquo; he said sharply; then, almost
      before the last word was out of his mouth, he abruptly excused himself and
      left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      He left silence behind him, and some little consternation; and Halloran,
      seeing on Mrs. Higgin-son's face the signs of a storm, excused himself,
      too, leaving Crosman to weather it as best he might.

      CHAPTER III&mdash;Tightening the Blockade
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Babcock had
      come in early this morning, depositing a small traveling-bag behind the
      door of his office, and then looking at his watch to see if Mr. Bigelow
      were not about due. Somewhat travel-stained was Mr. Babcock, as a glance
      at the mirror told him; and there was time to wash and change his linen
      before his senior should arrive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly entered Mr. Bigelow, pausing within the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Mr. Babcock. Did you find Michigan City still on the map?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock, giving a last flick at his coat-collar before the mirror,
      turned, listened, and laughed at his senior's little jest. The
      stenographer, sitting in her corner by the window, smiled and giggled.
      Young men at desks in the outer office snickered and chuckled over their
      books. The round-eyed office-boy tee-heed outright, and then, covered with
      fright and confusion, disappeared behind the water-cooler as the head of
      the firm passed on to the inner office.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrival of Mr. Babcock with a traveling-bag was, it seemed, to be
      considered important; more important even than the heap of letters that
      lay ready opened on the mahogany desk. For now Mr. Babcock had been
      summoned, the stenographer had been dismissed to some work in the outer
      office, and Mr. Bigelow, closely attentive, and Mr. Babcock, with much to
      communicate in that low voice of his, were settling down to consider a
      problem.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The price appealed to them,&rdquo; Mr. Babcock was saying, &ldquo;but they are afraid
      of Higginson. They admit it. Higginson, they say, has their written order
      to cut out the timber at the old price. Higginson, on his part, has agreed
      to deliver the entire bill, two hundred thousand feet or more, at the
      wharf at Michigan City, by the fourteenth of this month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow's eyes strayed to his desk calendar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on Mr. Babcock, &ldquo;to-day's the eleventh. That gives us three
      days to stop it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point there was an interruption. As had happened once before when
      these two gentlemen were talking, the door opened and the small office-boy
      appeared, catching his breath hurriedly before getting out the words:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lady t' see y'u, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A decisive utterance was hanging on Mr. Bigelow's lips; a hand was raised
      to make it more emphatic, but the lips closed and the hand fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will excuse me, Mr. Babcock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be engaged only a moment.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The discreet Mr. Babcock withdrew, and the head of the firm, with a glance
      at the heap of letters still untouched, turned, without rising, toward the
      door. There was a curious expression on his face, the expression of a man
      who feels himself at last in a position to cut knots, who knows that he
      commands the situation. A person who might choose to break in on such a
      weighty conference this morning need not be surprised at summary
      treatment. And as the woman entered and softly closed the door he leaned a
      little forward and drew his brows together, his whole appearance saying
      plainly: &ldquo;My time is short, madam. Speak to the point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman faltered and waited for his question. He said not a word. She
      started to speak, but seemed unable to break through this heavy silence.
      He waited, his brows coming down more and more. And at last, when the
      words did pass her lips, they were not at all what she had meant to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have tried not to come to you again. God knows how it hurts me. But I
      had to come. I was turned out of the New York Store ten days ago, without
      warning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Once started, she was finding it a little easier to go on; but Mr.
      Bigelow, carrying the weight of millions on his shoulders, dealing hourly
      with questions of importance, greater or less, to the whole commercial
      world, had no time now&mdash;kind as he may have been in the more
      leisurely past&mdash;to waste on trivial matters. He had given the woman a
      chance; was he to blame for her failure? Did &ldquo;not potential success exist
      within every human being? Was any man to blame for the shipwreck of
      another?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know nothing about that,&rdquo; he cut in shortly and finally. &ldquo;There is no
      use in bringing your story here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She quailed before him. &ldquo;But I have a right&mdash;the law&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The law is yours to use. If you think it will help you, use it.&rdquo; He rose,
      opened the door, and bowed her out. And she, baffled, humiliated, at the
      end of her resources, went out without a word, crossed the hall as
      steadily as any young stenographer, stepped into the elevator with a
      composed face, and out into the street&mdash;and all this while there was
      nothing to mark her out from a thousand other ill-dressed women; nothing
      to show that her hopes were gone; simply a plain woman on La Salle Street,
      quietly walking&mdash;where? Where could she walk now? Were there still
      depths to sound, or had she reached the bottom?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Babcock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The junior partner came out from his own private office at the sound of
      his senior's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were saying,&rdquo; said Mr. Bigelow, taking up the thread where they had
      laid it down, &ldquo;that Higginson &amp; Company have agreed to deliver the
      timber by the fourteenth. Now, of course, a blockade, to be effective,
      must be complete.&rdquo; This was self-evident to Mr. Babcock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so long as these people are free to deliver lumber the blockade is
      not complete. What is your plan regarding this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Michigan City people, as I said, are afraid of Higginson. But they
      will accept our price the minute we can show them that they're safe in
      doing it. They received a letter from Higginson's manager yesterday
      stating that the Higginson steamer, with the timber, will reach Michigan
      City on the night of the thirteenth or the morning of the fourteenth. That
      means that it will be ready for loading on the twelfth&mdash;to-morrow&mdash;and
      that the steamer will start the morning of the thirteenth. Now, it's not
      hard to imagine a delay that would keep the Higginson manager from getting
      the boat off in time. And if he fails to deliver, we are promised the
      order.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you mean to do this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock glanced around in that cautious way of' his, leaned forward,
      and buzzed along rapidly for a few moments, his eyes keen with eagerness.
      The senior partner listened closely and slowly nodded, to show that he
      understood. Even Mr. Bigelow, as we have seen, was not wholly free from
      annoyance. Head of the Lumber Trust was Mr. Bigelow, but not,
      unfortunately, sole owner of the Lumber Trust. Fighting is expensive; and
      voting heads of constituent companies are sometimes unreasonable about
      expenses. Mr. Bigelow was skilful and resourceful; he knew well how to
      paint rainbows that should dazzle even the hard-headed, hard-fisted old
      lumbermen of Michigan; he understood how to make it plain that money spent
      in defeating Higginson would come back threefold when the defeat was over,
      and the price up where it should be, and the &ldquo;economies&rdquo; of the trust in
      working order; he was shrewd, and he knew that the sooner Higginson could
      be run out of business the better it would be for him (to say nothing of
      the trust and its directors). And so it was indeed important that the
      blockade should be made effective. The railroads were practically closed
      to Higginson now, his customers were to be had for the buying, but the
      steamers of the Higginson line were still afloat and ready to deliver
      Higginson lumber at contract prices. The Michigan City contract was not a
      matter of money; there was a principle at stake. Higginson <i>must not</i>
      deliver that lumber on the fourteenth!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; he said, nodding again. &ldquo;Have you the right man for this
      work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Buzz&mdash;buzz&mdash;from Mr. Babcock. More words from Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will have to move quickly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am off now,&rdquo; and the junior partner headed for the traveling-bag,
      feeling in his pocket for a time-table.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;Mr. Babcock Breakfasts Late
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he thirteenth was
      a storm-centre at Wauchung. At six in the morning, while Mr. William H.
      Babcock was sleeping peacefully in a Grand Rapids hotel, dreaming sweet
      dreams and smiling childlike smiles, conscious even in slumberland that
      his work was accomplished; while the Martin L. Higginson No. 1 was lying
      at the Higginson wharves with two hundred and fifteen thousand feet of
      lumber aboard, Halloran was up and tumbling into his clothes. Captain
      Craig, master of the Higginson No. 1, was sitting grimly on the corner of
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know the man?&rdquo; Halloran was asking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say whom he was acting for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      At seven o'clock the No. 1. should be leaving the harbour; but here was
      her master sitting on Halloran's bed, his seamed old face set hard with
      the thoughts that were boiling behind it. Down by the mills, where the
      first early risers were lounging in, where the lumber piles stretching far
      along the wharves were glistening yellow under the light of the new sun,
      all was quiet even to the steamer, whose stoke-room was cold, whose
      boilers were giving out no sounds of preparation for the twelve-hour
      journey. Over at Grand Rapids Mr. Babcock was still sleeping the sleep of
      the just, dreaming once more that his man had come in by a late train to
      report that all was well at Wauchung. And still Halloran was jerking
      himself into his clothes, pulling on his old purple sweater rather than
      waste time over collar and tie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I'm ready.&rdquo; Then he paused. The next move was not
      to be settled offhand. &ldquo;You went around to Billy's house, Captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I've just come from there. The way that fellow talked bothered me so
      last night that I couldn't sleep much. I got to thinking it over after I'd
      gone to bed, and it struck me that if he wanted to cripple the line he'd
      hardly stop at me. He'd go for Billy sure, for a good engineer isn't an
      easy man to replace. And they tell me Billy hasn't been seen at his
      boarding-house since noon yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very true, Captain Craig! A good suggestion just now when Halloran is
      still shaking the sleep from his eyes and trying to get these amazing
      facts in hand, and to relate them with certain suspicions that rose at the
      first word. It will probably occur to Halloran, when once he shall get
      facts, suspicions and all firmly gripped in his mind, that heads of trusts
      do not fight haphazard; that if certain deliveries of timber are to be
      prevented heads of trusts are not accustomed to move in vain. It is Mr.
      Bigelow's habit to arrive at results: no getting off at way-stations for
      G. Hyde Bigelow; and obstinate persons who venture on open warfare with
      the Great must shake the sleep out very early in the morning if they hope
      to reach even a way-station along the Bigelow line. Steamers cannot be run
      without engineers: engineers cannot be had for the whistling in far-away
      Michigan ports with but forty hours of grace&mdash;forty valuable hours
      not a whit longer than other everyday hours; even shorter&mdash;hours that
      were diminishing, were growing more valuable, would soon be precious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much did this man offer you?&rdquo; Halloran asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Five hundred a year more salary and a bonus of five hundred extra, cash
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he show the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a big roll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meant business, didn't he?&rdquo; said Halloran dryly. &ldquo;First thing we do, we'd
      better go down and see if we have anybody left. Then we can talk better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So they went down to the wharves, where they found a few wandering
      deckhands by the silent steamer. Evidently deckhands were not important to
      trusts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess Billy took the bait,&rdquo; Halloran observed. &ldquo;He is never as late as
      this, is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there is only one thing to do next, Captain. We've got to get her
      down to Michigan City before to-morrow night whether the Trust likes it or
      not. Do you suppose they've gobbled up the tug men, too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was not a hard fact to discover, for there were only two tugs in the
      harbour; and sure enough, when, twenty minutes later, the manager for
      Higginson &amp; Company and the Captain of the No. 1 met again on the
      wharf, they were both beginning to understand how clean a sweep the Trust
      people had made of it. The Captain was growing angrier every minute, and
      so was Halloran. The rascality of it was what aroused the Captain. Waters
      and winds he could understand, but the ways of men were beyond him. Two
      days before, in Chicago, Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow had announced that Higginson
      &amp; Company must not make the delivery at Michigan City; and this
      resulting moment, with Halloran sitting on the iron cap of a snubbing-post
      and the Captain standing silent before him, was a very dark moment for the
      Wauchung interests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The damned old rascal,&rdquo; said Halloran, reflectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      Craig's dull eye suddenly flashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to have foreseen it,&rdquo; he burst out. &ldquo;It's the kind of thing to
      expect from that Bigelow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied Halloran; &ldquo;that's what I've been saying to myself. This is
      a pretty fair sample of Bigelow's methods.&rdquo; He was chagrined to think that
      it could be done so easily. He had thought of anything, everything, but
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to set Bigelow's head on that pile of two-by-fours,&rdquo; Halloran
      went on, &ldquo;and have about three shots at him. I don't believe he'd know
      himself the next time he looked in the glass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain glanced at him mistrustfully. He liked this manager, but this
      was not the time for jokes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever see him?&rdquo; asked Halloran, swinging a leg on each side of the
      snubbing-post and letting a twinkle come into his eyes as his thoughts
      seemed to run on Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain sighed an impatient negative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a big, vain man. You ought to see him come into church Sunday
      mornings and swell down the aisle, with his wife and children trotting
      after him. He's proud of being thought the big financial man in the
      church; and whenever they'll let him he gets up after the sermon and makes
      a speech about the church debts. Great temperance man, too&mdash;likes to
      preside at prohibition meetings and plead for the sanctity of the home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Captain Craig was scowling. Every moment the situation was growing more
      serious; and here was the manager of the company, sitting on a
      snubbing-post and swinging his legs. Men were needed now, thought the
      Captain angrily&mdash;grown men, not children.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One spring house-cleaning time&mdash;I generally put in the early
      mornings and evenings there&mdash;G. Hyde called me in&mdash;I was putting
      down the hall rugs just then&mdash;he called me in to light the gas. I had
      a match ready to strike and he reached over and took it away from me and
      put it back in the box. 'Young man,' he said&mdash;he never liked to
      remember my name&mdash;'do you know how I rose from nothing to be the
      owner of this property?' Then he picked up a burnt match, held it down to
      the grate, and lighted the gas with that.&rdquo; Hal-loran smiled a far-away
      smile. &ldquo;Aren't some of his steamers up at Pewaukoe now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question was asked in the same careless voice, and it took the Captain
      a moment to realize that the subject had been changed. Then he answered
      with a puzzled expression:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; the G. H. Bigelow should have come in there two or three days ago.
      The other boats are at Chicago or up on Lake Superior.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Big boat, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a good crew for her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, all at sea, could think of nothing but an affirmative to
      this.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the Captain's name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Carpenter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's the engineer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbie MacGregor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Robbie? Certainly. None better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran slid down off the post and looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Old G. Hyde is getting up just about now. He's a great hand at early
      rising&mdash;preaches a good deal about it&mdash;likes to say that if he
      hadn't been brought up on a good old gentleman known as B. Franklin he'd
      never be where he is now. Well, maybe he wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain's temper was hanging on the edge of an explosion, but Halloran
      went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to be done here now. Try to keep everything ready&mdash;if
      you can pick up a man to fire up, I should&mdash;and we'll probably get
      off this afternoon sometime.&rdquo; And he strolled off, leaving the Captain to
      stare after him and give vent to the first rumblings of a storm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran, in his old clothes and faded purple sweater and college cap, was
      headed for the railroad station. At the station he took the Pewaukoe
      train; at Pewaukoe he walked down to the mills, fairly certain that none
      of Bigelow's men there would recognize him. The <i>G. H. Bigelow</i> lay
      at the wharf, as Craig had said. She was taking on a cargo.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mills were on the low ground by the river. From the road he could
      overlook them and the great piles of lumber that crowded close to the
      water's edge for hundreds of yards up and down stream, and he leaned on
      the fence to take it in. As far up as he could see the river was blocked
      with logs. The mills were singing and buzzing and humming&mdash;it was
      plain that the Bigelow vitalizing process had begun, and that all hands
      were being crowded on the work in order to sell lumber at a loss to
      Higginson's customers. He thought he would walk down through the yards
      toward the steamer.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the unknown man, wearing a purple sweater and somewhat in need of a
      shave, walked past the shore end of the nearer mill, the eyes of the
      Superintendent fell upon him. A moment later the two met.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; said the Superintendent, suspicious but civil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First rate. How are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Want to see any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; just looking around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where were you going?&rdquo; asked the Superintendent, trying to veil his
      suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowhere especially. I didn't suppose they'd be any objection if I watched
      'em loading the steamer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;certainly not.&rdquo; This reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got a great lot of lumber here, haven't you?&rdquo; Halloran was looking, as he
      spoke, at a long pile that extended to a point within fifty feet of the
      mill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; working nights right along&mdash;with all the men I can get. That
      pile doesn't stay here; but we're so crowded I had to leave it over night&mdash;just
      until I get the Bigelow loaded up. I'm going to put on a big force this
      afternoon and carry it all down to the wharf. Some days lately we've been
      so crowded I really haven't known how I was going to get things done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly it was dawning on Halloran that he was suspected of being&mdash;not
      the manager for Higgin-son &amp; Company&mdash;but a lynx-eyed insurance
      inspector, out running down violations of the clear-space clause. This
      wouldn't do. It was not on his books to be drawn into an extended
      conversation with Bigelow's superintendent. He would have to fall back on
      lying if this were to keep up much longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say,&rdquo; he observed, &ldquo;what was that fellow doing down in the water, hopping
      around on the logs with a long pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Superintendent was beginning to lose interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He picks out logs of the right sizes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say he can tell just by looking at a log in the water
      what size it will cut to?&rdquo; A curt nod was the only reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it remarkable how a man can get trained to things? Now if I were to
      try a thing like that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the Superintendent had fled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran walked slowly on to the wharf, and stood watching the gangs that
      were carrying the heavy sticks over the rail of the steamer. Two steam
      hoists were clanking and rattling as the booms swung back and forth.
      Bosses were shouting and swearing&mdash;everywhere was confusion, but
      confusion that moved steadily onward toward the loading of the steamer.
      Halloran dodged around the labourers and walked along the wharf until he
      was opposite the engine-room door. Within was a fat man in overalls
      tinkering over the machinery. Halloran climbed up to the deck and stood in
      the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;Nice day!&rdquo; The engineer nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be Mr. MacGregor, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine is Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacGregor looked up, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am with Higginson &amp; Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacGregor did not know what to make of this. Halloran, however, went right
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like working for Bigelow?&rdquo; And without leaving time to reply,
      he added: &ldquo;Mean old humbug, ain't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you know about Bigelow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Used to work for him myself. I had all I wanted of him. He isn't square.
      That's what brings me here. We need a good engineer, and Captain Craig
      tells me you are the best on the lakes. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacGregor's mind had not caught up yet; and Halloran continued:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to take you back to Wauchung with me. We will raise your salary
      five hundred dollars, and engage you for as long a time as you think
      right! You know Higginson &amp; Company&mdash;and you know we keep our
      promises. Then you can tell Bigelow to go to hell if you want to. I know
      how Bigelow's men feel.&rdquo; He looked at his watch. &ldquo;We can get the 9:53
      train down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to go this morning?&rdquo; said MacGregor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; right off. You surely have an assistant you can leave in charge of
      the engine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fat man backed up against the opposite door and looked at Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what does this mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mean?&rdquo;&mdash;Halloran's anger, that had been rising since six o'clock,
      began to boil over&mdash;&ldquo;Mean? It means that Bigelow has come into the
      lumber business with the idea of running Higginson out. And if you know
      anything about Martin L. Higginson you know that old Bigelow has bitten
      off the biggest hunk he ever tried to get his mouth around. It means that
      G. Hyde Bigelow's going to get such a hob-nailed roost in the breeches
      that he'll be lucky to come down at all. He's going to have the whole
      damned zodiac buzzing around in his head before he gets through with
      Higginson&mdash;that's what it means! I've come up here this morning to
      tell you that we want an engineer, and that you're the man we want. And we
      want you to go on the 9:53 train&mdash;that's about forty minutes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      MacGregor was thinking hard. He knew a little about Bigelow and a good
      deal more about Higginson. He liked the phrase, too&mdash;what was it&mdash;oh,
      &ldquo;the best engineer on the lakes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you give me a day to think it over, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry, but I'm afraid not. We need you right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say your offer was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you think is fair. But I'll tell you flatly, we'll pay you more than
      Bigelow will&mdash;five hundred a year more. You have just about
      comfortable time to get up to your house and change your clothes. I'll
      meet you at the station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What if Bigelow should make trouble about my contract?&rdquo; asked MacGregor
      dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you worry a minute about that. We'll back you up to the last
      notch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      MacGregor thought it over a little longer. Then he turned his ponderous
      frame and called to his assistant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said over his shoulder to Halloran, &ldquo;I'll meet you at the
      station.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Mr. William H. Babcock was rising from a hotel breakfast in
      Grand Rapids and reaching for the toothpicks. As he strolled out to the
      office to buy a paper he picked his teeth and smiled softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Feeling painfully outside of it all&mdash;almost inclined to wonder if his
      troubles were real, if the mills behind him, the lumber piled on either
      side of him, the laden steamer before him were real; if this round world,
      even, with its mixture of ups and downs and ins and outs, were real&mdash;Mr.
      Higginson stood on the wharf at Captain Craig's side. The steamer's fires
      had not yet been started and it was now after eleven o'clock. The
      engineers had disappeared, and with them the oilers and stokers; the
      wheelmen were gone, and the lookouts&mdash;nothing left in Wauchung but a
      few deckhands. And now, to cap it all, Halloran had dropped suddenly off
      the surface of the earth, leaving a certain old Scotch captain to rumble
      internally and now and then to burst into eruption with scorching phrases
      about boys that ought to be back in the nursery, about babes that had been
      prematurely weaned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this scene of gloom and desolation came Halloran, recognizable
      half-way up to the mill by the purple sweater, carrying a bulging canvas
      telescope; and following him, somewhat scant of breath, hurried a fat man
      with a patent-leather valise. The gloomy ones observed them at the same
      moment. Mr. Higginson gave a nervous start, then was swept by a feeling of
      relief that almost brought a smile to his face. The Captain looked&mdash;and
      looked&mdash;and&mdash;the rumblings ceased. Nothing further was heard
      that day about nursing-bottles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, Robbie,&rdquo; was all that Craig could bring himself to say when the
      fat man had reached the wharf and set down his valise and begun swabbing
      his face with a handkerchief that showed signs of use since he had fallen
      into Halloran's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Cap'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson drew his manager aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is this man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is the new engineer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson's eyes shifted from Halloran to the fat man and back again
      two or three times. Then, as time was pressing, he decided to ask no
      questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a man up the river that understands firing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Crosman
      has gone up to get him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have we any wheelmen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, one of Craig's old men is in the mill. When do you plan to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away&mdash;as soon as we can fire up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson was on the point of suggesting a wait until the next
      morning, but he withheld this, too. And so Halloran, who had promised to
      deliver the lumber by the morning of the fourteenth, and who would have,
      taken the steamer down himself rather than give Bigelow the pleasure of
      delaying him fifteen minutes, went on with the work of preparation.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three o'clock that afternoon they were off, with one man in the
      wheel-house, a quartet of clumsy deckhands in the stoke-hole, a devoutly
      profane fat man in the engine-room, and one combined lookout and deckhand
      by the name of Halloran&mdash;every man of them facing a solid twelve
      hours on duty. Never had steamer gone out between the Wauchung piers in
      such plight before. If the white-clad Swede in the lookout of the
      life-saving station could have seen through the walls of this good ship <i>Higginson</i>,
      could have known the facts that lay behind this brave front, he would have
      wagged his head dubiously and long.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the stars were kind on the thirteenth of this month. Captain Craig,
      standing on the wheel-house and guiding her out toward deep water, found
      himself looking on a flat mirror that blended, miles away, into the blue
      sky. Streaked with wide reaches of green and purple and corn-colour was
      Lake Michigan to-day&mdash;wearing her gladdest dress over a calm heart.
      And Halloran and the Captain, both of whom knew her temper, who had met
      once, indeed, when she was angriest, near Evanston a few years earlier&mdash;recognized
      themselves for very lucky men.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the old <i>Higginson No. 1</i> headed southward, and plowed
      deliberately down past Point Sable, and heaved out a long line of black
      smoke just as if she had been a real full-handed steamer with real firemen
      throwing coal into the greedy furnaces. There was even some enthusiasm
      aboard; not one even of the stokers but knew dimly that they were
      fighting. They even felt, the younger ones, like men marching into battle,
      and when the <i>Higginson</i> was fairly out on the lake and swinging
      around on her course, one amateur fireman of the watch below ran down the
      ladder to pass the good news to his less fortunate brethren on duty. And
      if the heat of the work had been less trying, these grimy fellows,
      stripped to the drawers and covered with sweat and coal, might even have
      given three cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They ran down slowly, of course. It was getting on toward daylight when
      the <i>Higginson</i> steamed into the harbour at Michigan City and tied up
      at the wharf of the lumber company, and it was a heartily exhausted set of
      men that rolled into their bunks to snatch a wink before day should come,
      bringing more work with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At eight o'clock Halloran walked over to the Company's office and inquired
      for the manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm Halloran,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;of Higginson &amp; Company. How soon can you
      begin unloading?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right away,&rdquo; replied the manager civilly, but with an odd expression.
      &ldquo;I'm just sending some men down.&rdquo; His surprise was so great that it had to
      find some expression. He seemed to be thinking it over as he left his desk
      to go to the wharf. Finally, with an effort at an off-hand manner, he
      added, &ldquo;You're prompt on time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure,&rdquo; replied Halloran. &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER V&mdash;A Venture in Matrimony
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was Saturday
      night on the North Side, and shortly after six o'clock. That part of the
      world that centres in North Clark Street between Lincoln Park and the
      Bridge was already beginning to stir and stretch and shake off the dust of
      the day; was swarming in from scores of cross streets, to parade before
      the show-windows and pour into the beer-gardens and restaurants, to crowd
      at the corners&mdash;a motley company of washed and unwashed; of labourers
      and shopgirls hurrying home, and of more fortunate ones, old and young,
      sauntering from home, to get out of life what North Clark Street had to
      offer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strains of dance music floated out over board fences that were gaudy with
      posters, out over evergreen hedges that thrived in green tubs. All the
      world was gay to-night; all the world was in the mood to sit at white
      tables under the trees and dine on the best of German fare, to tip back
      and listen to German music from German orchestras, to toss the waiter half
      a dollar; life was gay, life was jolly; all was well with the world. No
      half-lights here, no miserly crouching in shadows, no gloomy ones to spoil
      it all; nothing but froth on the glass, a laugh on the lip, and here's
      looking at you!
    </p>
    <p>
      But think again. Of all these houses of amusement was there not one
      standing empty&mdash;was there not one where gloom reigned? Glance along
      the street, pass the policeman on the corner&mdash;the fat policeman, for
      whose sake we will hope all thieves are slow of foot&mdash;down past other
      corners and other fat policemen, down almost to the river, so near that
      the smell of the water poisons the air. Was there not a dingy little
      playhouse, overwhelmed by the soot and grime of the city, by the noise of
      the trains that seemed to be rushing into the building with bells ringing
      and every steam-valve open&mdash;overwhelmed, too, by the rattle and
      struggle of the street, and the large buildings that crowded so close on
      each side that they threatened to come together with a snap and leave no
      trace of the dingy little structure with its <i>porte cochere</i> front.
      If there was, anywhere in this big city, a building that spoke of failure,
      of pitiful inadequacy for any metropolitan purpose, of aimlessness and
      inevitable wreckage, here it stood, bearing the hesitating announcement
      that within might be found Somebody's Original Oriental Burlesquers and
      Refined Vaudeville.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not long after six o'clock was it, and the lingering remnants of a very
      thin audience were rapidly escaping before the onslaught of the &ldquo;chasers.&rdquo;
       The particular chaser that held the stage at the moment was a tall, thin
      young man, rather nimble as to the legs, who was exercising a sound pair
      of lungs on a song, a tender memory of a certain Bridget O'Grady, who, he
      vowed, was a perfect lady. The fiddles squeaked and rasped, the piano
      tinkled, the bass viol rumbled in loudest of all; and the audience grew
      thinner and thinner&mdash;narrowed down, in fact, to a few questionable
      individuals who had, one feared, no better place to go. After the song
      there was a dance in which the nimble legs appeared to some advantage. And
      if we had been tucked away in a corner of that dirty stage, behind the
      wings that were slit and frayed from years of service&mdash;if we had
      watched the Irish vocalist when he came off and readjusted his carroty
      wig, we could not have failed to recognize in the possessor of the nimble
      legs and the sound lungs our old friend Apples.
    </p>
    <p>
      Somewhere in the course of his career Apples had dropped a stitch; for the
      goal of all true Thespians, the myriad-minded Shakespeare, was still only
      a waking dream for Apples, was still no more than a twinkling
      constellation that shone and shone in the far heavens, serenely
      unconscious that one Appleton Le Duc was striving upward. But was it not
      an encouragement to recall the inspiriting words of the professor of
      elocution, that Shakespeare himself had been a country boy; that he, too,
      had gone to the city to seek his fortune; that he, too, had stumbled and
      struggled, and climbed and climbed until he had reached the highest
      pinnacle of fame?
    </p>
    <p>
      Something was certainly on the mind of the rising actor to-night&mdash;something
      that elevated him above the dingy hall and the sleepy audience. Pausing
      only to mop his brow, back he went in response to his encore&mdash;the
      encore that was mentioned in his contract&mdash;as cheerfully as if the
      audience had really given him a hand; and the sound lungs burst out again,
      to another scraping, tinkling, rumbling accompaniment; and the voice of
      Apples rose high in the praise of 'Mary, my fairy, the Maid of Ochlone,'
      whose heart-dum-de-dumdy-dum-surely-my-own. The sight of a newspaper
      spread wide before the face of the only occupant of an orchestra seat
      could not disturb Apples this evening; the glimpse of two newsboys in the
      gallery, aiming with peanuts at the bald head behind the newspaper, could
      not so much as ruffle him; for golden-haired Mary, dee-doodle-dee-fairy,
      dee-iddle-dee-airy, ta raddle-my-own. Very blithe was Apples, strangely
      blithe for an underpaid chaser in the most despondent theatre on the North
      Side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another little scene taking place at this time in which we are
      interested. In the lodging of Mrs. Craig&mdash;not two rooms now, but one,
      with a decrepit cook-stove in one corner and a ragged quilt hung across
      another corner to serve as a partition between George's bedroom and the
      rest of the space&mdash;a silent woman was cooking a meager supper. A very
      silent woman was Mrs. Craig at this time, even more so than formerly. The
      room was hot and close with the odour of cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this home, at a little before six, came Lizzie Bigelow, grown rather
      more mature in appearance since we last saw her, of a rounder figure and a
      brighter colour. She was in good spirits to-night. By some miracle she was
      as fresh and healthy as if she had been given nothing but the best of
      food, the purest air and plenty of time for exercise; and to the mother it
      seemed as if a whiff of fresh air had come with her into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Lizzie, you are back early.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I got off at half-past five. Where is George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has to work late to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; I forgot. You are tired, ma. You sit down awhile and let me
      finish the supper.&rdquo; She was throwing aside her hat and jacket as she
      spoke, and she smiled at her mother in a way that brought an expression of
      gratefulness and surprise to the face of the older woman. &ldquo;Now you just
      sit down awhile. I'm going to get supper ready to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It appeared that she really meant it; and the mother, after a little
      protesting, made way for her by the stove. Indeed, it promised to be quite
      a jolly evening, if only George could get home in time to share it. Even
      without him, what with a merry recital of the funny things that had
      happened at the office during the day, and with other talk of an equally
      unusual good humour, Mrs. Craig was almost bewildered. She knew only too
      well how unexpectedly Lizzie's high spirits could turn corners, how
      petulant this merry, black-eyed girl could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, announcing that she was going to get a breath of fresh air,
      Lizzie went out, first ingeniously smuggling a small package outside the
      door under pretense of opening it for air. Next she put on her hat and
      jacket and stood for a moment smiling; finally she bent over her mother
      and kissed her, an act so surprising that Mrs. Craig flushed with
      pleasure. Then, with a nervous little laugh and a fling of her skirts, she
      had whisked out and the door was closed. There was a pause at the top of
      the stairs while she fumbled in her pocket for a folded slip of paper
      which she tucked silently into the crack of the door; but at last she was
      off, running down the stairs with her bundle held tightly under her
      jacket, and hurrying across the street to avoid meeting George in case he
      should be returning home at this hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The encore was over and Apples was hurrying, wig in hand, to the
      dressing-room. There he threw off his costume, dressed for the street,
      packed all his &ldquo;properties&rdquo; hastily in an old valise, and went out at the
      stage-door. The doorkeeper nodded to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're off now, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I'm through here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got your pay?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're lucky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess I am. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apples, still hurrying, still wanting breath, turned the corner, paused,
      looked up the street and down, seemed disappointed and irresolute, and
      finally turned his valise on end and sat on it. From where he sat in the
      shadow of a dark building he could see the flow of life along North Clark
      Street, and he watched it nervously. He seemed somewhat oppressed by the
      rush and whirl of things, as if in mid-course of a tempestuous career he
      had paused to think. The soot-laden air was portentous to-night; the
      rattle and rumble of the street, the guffaws from the actors' saloon at
      his elbow, the roar and hurry of it all, bore heavily on his spirits as he
      sat waiting there. For Apples was on the brink of something&mdash;something
      new and strange. Before him lay an unexplored country, and who could say
      if it should prove a land of roses or a black abyss. For better or worse
      it was to be, a plunge into the future, vastly unlike certain other
      plunges that he had been forced to take&mdash;alone. Circumstances had
      swept him on; the offer had come, bearing the guarantee that at last his
      name should appear on all posters in letters not shorter than three and
      one-half inches; the other one, whose face and voice had helped to make it
      all possible, was willing, with a fluttering heart, to keep her promise;
      the small boy with the wizened face, whose thin legs were to help make
      their joint fortunes, had jumped at the chance; and here he was on the
      brink. Henceforth the three Le Ducs, three, were to be a feature in the
      theatrical world. And the black sky, bearing oppressively down like an
      emblem of great grim Chicago, was portentous indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last a woman, with a small package under her jacket, slipped out from
      the crowd and came hesitatingly down the side street. Apples rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got everything?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; where's Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's waiting at the pier.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so, without speaking further, these two young persons, who were about
      to take the plunge hand in hand, set out together toward the east. A block
      farther on she said, with a show of petulance, &ldquo;Have we got to take Jimmie
      along?&rdquo;
     </p>

      They crossed over the Rush Street bridge and took the early steamer for
      St. Joseph. From now on they should have no difficulty. There was a
      reverend person in St. Joseph who was always glad to marry foolish young
      men and foolish young girls, for a consideration. And this reverend one,
      in the evening's rest after a day given to guiding his flock heavenward,
      could surely find a few moments in which to make these two one. They could
      be sure of finding discretion here, sure that no awkward questions would
      be asked, that no permission from unreasonable parents would be hinted at;
      sure, in brief, that the good divine would be entirely at their service,
      would wish them Godspeed on the up-road or the down-road or any
      conceivable road&mdash;for a consideration.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI&mdash;A Shut-down
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he weeks went
      spinning by. Both sides were losing so heavily that the fight was becoming
      grim. On the one hand, Bigelow, with his unreasonable directors to keep in
      line, was closing in relentlessly on the Wauchung interests; on the other
      hand, Higginson &amp; Company were holding on with an endurance that
      puzzled Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      And it was at this time, when affairs were leaping along toward a crisis,
      that Doctor Brown of Wauchung took a hand by ordering Mr. Higginson to
      bed. Nothing but a complete rest could save him from a breakdown, said the
      Doctor&mdash;news which brought Mrs. Higginson down with nervous
      exhaustion, which set Mamie's wits a-fluttering, which complicated matters
      somewhat for Halloran. The longer Halloran studied the business, the
      longer he pored over statements of profits and statements of losses that
      could not be brought together, the plainer became the facts.. Ideas were
      floating in his head, ideas so nearly what he wanted that he knew it would
      be only a question of time before he could catch one or the other of them
      and bring it down into the world of reality&mdash;ideas that were later to
      be brought to bear, perhaps, on Bigelow and his combination; but meanwhile
      his course was clear. The logical next step was to shut down the mills.
    </p>
    <p>
      He dared not think of all the details in connection with such a step, of
      what it would mean to Mr. Higginson, to the hundreds of men who had grown
      up in the work, or to what few other business interests there were in
      Wauchung; the mere consideration of the moral issue involved led into such
      a maze of pros and cons that he resolutely set it aside and kept his mind
      fixed on the business facts. If this step were not taken, the heavy
      expense of maintenance would swamp Higginson &amp; Company and everybody
      connected with them so deep that all the king's horses could not drag them
      out; by shutting down, on the other hand, he could prolong the fight. The
      trust would be free to continue selling at a loss; but Higginson &amp;
      Company would be enabled to leave their timber growing in the forest until
      prices should reach normal again.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Higginson's whole fortune was in the business, his income was now
      next to nothing; but Halloran believed he could hold out six months or so
      longer. On the other hand, he did not think Bigelow could last so long at
      the head of a losing venture. Indeed, if for one moment of those tense
      days he had lost his belief that Bigelow could be beaten, Halloran would
      have dropped out of this story on this page.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening Doctor Brown received a call from the Manager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Doctor,&rdquo; said Halloran, when they were seated in the office, &ldquo;what
      can you tell me about Mr. Higginson? Is he better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician shook his head. &ldquo;No&mdash;no better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You consider his case serious?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo;&mdash;gravely&mdash;&ldquo;it is serious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you, Doctor&mdash;for you must understand it before you can
      answer me&mdash;that the business is in a situation that demands his
      attention if he is able to give it&mdash;even for five minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Brown shook his head again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I not lay a decision before him, Doctor, if I make it as clear and
      simple as possible?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a decision would be the last thing to bother him with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran sat thinking. This was difficult&mdash;very difficult, indeed.
      Shutting down another man's mills without his knowledge was not the sort
      of thing he liked to do. The physician spoke again:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His mind <i>must</i> have a rest, Mr. Halloran; that is the only way we
      can save him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was final, and Halloran went out to return to his room and pore again
      over accounts and statements, to think again of Bigelow, to grope again
      for those ideas that seemed so nearly what he wanted. For another week he
      watched the expense account mounting up; then one day he sent for Crosman
      to come to his office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Crosman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;the mills will shut down Saturday night. Will you
      please see that the men are notified?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman looked at Halloran for a moment to make sure that he understood;
      then with a puzzled expression he left the room. Later in the day he met
      Halloran in the yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Am I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Do you want me to leave Saturday?&rdquo; he asked,
      his voice full of emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; the Manager replied shortly, &ldquo;you stay; I want you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening Halloran was at work in his room when Crosman came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just happened around at Higginson's,&rdquo; he said, evidently somewhat
      embarrassed, &ldquo;and Mamie said that her father wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When&mdash;now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran pushed aside his work with a thoughtful face. Presently he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are going back that way, I'll walk along with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by Mamie herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;I don't know what to say. Father isn't
      well at all&mdash;he's so nervous and excitable. Doctor Brown told me this
      morning not to let him see you at all, but he says he must see you&mdash;he
      made me send Harry as soon as he got here. I haven't known what to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran heard her through, then he went directly up-stairs. Mr.
      Higginson's room was dimly lighted, and it was a moment before his eyes
      could distinguish clearly; but when he finally made out the thin figure
      propped up on the bed he was shocked at the change the sickness had
      wrought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; Mr. Higginson was saying. &ldquo;Tell me what this means.&rdquo; His voice
      was tremulous with feeling. &ldquo;What is this they have been telling me about
      closing the mills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true. I have arranged to shut down Saturday night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;True, is it?&rdquo; The lean old figure stirred on its pillows; the thin
      fingers closed tightly on a fold of the bedclothes. &ldquo;Do you know what you
      are saying, man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can't afford to pay men for doing nothing, Mr. Higginson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you realize what this means?&rdquo; The old man raised himself on his elbow;
      he found it difficult to control his voice. &ldquo;Do you know that I brought
      those men here, that I have supported some of them for thirty years? Do
      you think they can be cast off to starve? Why didn't you come to me with
      this? What do you mean by settling it out of hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't been allowed to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not been allowed! Is this a conspiracy? There's some meaning to this,
      Halloran. I insist upon knowing it. Do you mean that I have got to the
      end? Have we lost?&rdquo; The last few words were spoken with a sudden return to
      calmness; but his eyes were shining.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not at all. I think we shall win.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think!&mdash;for God's sake, Halloran, speak out and have it over
      with. What's the matter&mdash;what has happened?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran came over and sat on the edge of the bed where he could talk in a
      quiet voice; &ldquo;We have not lost, Mr. Higginson, and what's more, we aren't
      going to lose. Bigelow's people have got to keep on selling below cost
      until something happens. We certainly couldn't go on running full- handed
      without a cent of income. By shutting down we can hold out longer than
      they can. It's hard on the men, but it is hard on the rest of us, too.
      It's the only way we can meet them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even a sick man could see the soundness of this. And somehow the presence
      of his manager, with his air of health and confidence, went a long ways
      toward restoring, for the moment, the balance of Mr. Higginson's mind. He
      fell back on the pillows, unstrung after his excitement, but somewhat
      relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran said good-night and went downstairs. Mamie heard his step and,
      leaving Crosman in the sitting-room, she met him in the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I meant to tell you not to come down yet,&rdquo; she said with lowered eyes.
      &ldquo;Ma said that she wanted to see you when you came in. I'll go ahead if you
      don't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He followed her to another upstairs room, where he found Mrs. Higginson on
      a couch, dressed in the daintiest of lace-trimmed dressing-sacks. She
      looked up when he entered and motioned wearily to a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is kind of you to come,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mamie, dear, won't you get me my
      heavy shawl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mamie, understanding, left the room and did not hurry back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to talk with you about our dear girl,&rdquo; began Mrs. Higginson. &ldquo;Of
      course, if the worst should happen&mdash;you understand&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
       Here her emotion overcame her for a moment. &ldquo;You can understand what a
      shock it has been to me. Mr. H. had not told me of the trouble, and the
      news that he had failed came like a thunderbolt. I don't mind for myself&mdash;but
      if anything should happen&mdash;if the worst&mdash;I could go so much&mdash;so
      much easier&mdash;if I knew that Mamie was provided for. You will be good
      to her, John? You will forgive me for calling you John? It is the way Mr.
      H. always spoke of you at home&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; She was obliged to
      pause again. &ldquo;I am afraid he will never c&mdash;call you John again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her handkerchief went up to her eyes; and Halloran sat back and looked
      hard at a picture of the first Higginson mill, in oils, that hung over the
      mantel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we shall have to sell the house,&rdquo; she went on, rallying. &ldquo;You
      will know best about that, John. I am sure you will act for the best, and
      save what you can for our little girl. You will be good to her&mdash;I am
      sure you will. She has learned to admire you very much. And when we are&mdash;when
      we are no longer&mdash;and the house is gone&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing of that sort will be necessary,&rdquo; broke in Halloran, glad to
      relieve her mind and the gloom at the same time. &ldquo;The house needn't be
      sold. I think we shall have the mills running again before so very long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw, as he spoke, that his words struck a discordant note. She looked
      at him incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so bad as it sounds&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He meant to
      make it better, but, failing, stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean that we have been given this shock for nothing?&rdquo; she asked,
      with returning strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      The only way out was retreat. He rose, saying, &ldquo;I hope to have good news
      for you soon,&rdquo; and bowed a good-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Mamie sitting on the stairs in the dark with the shawl across her
      lap. She got up with a little sob and stood back against the rail for him
      to pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, Miss Higginson,&rdquo; he said in a low voice, &ldquo;It isn't a failure at
      all. We are getting on as well as we could expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put both hands on the railing to steady herself and looked up at him
      in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean that!&rdquo; she whispered, &ldquo;what you said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded. &ldquo;You needn't bother about it at all. Everything is all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She Still doubted. &ldquo;But the mills?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mills will be running soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, really?&rdquo; she said, almost wonderingly. &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The sobs were coming again. She caught his hand in both of hers and held
      it tightly. &ldquo;Then there isn't any failure&mdash;and you are going to save
      our home for us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was frying-pan to fire. Halloran answered hastily:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It won't be necessary to save it. We shall be all right again soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His matter-of-fact tone brought her to herself. She released his hand and,
      suddenly plunged into confusion, hurried upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      On his way out Halloran paused in the hall. Through the wide doorway he
      could see Crosman, out in the sitting-room, striding around with his hands
      in his pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Crosman,&rdquo; he ventured.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other would not hear him; and Halloran, feeling as if he had been
      put through a wringer, went out.

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;Halloran Goes to Chicago
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he next morning&mdash;it
      chanced to be a Friday&mdash;Crosman came over to Halloran's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you a couple of minutes?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Surely. More than I want. Sit down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman did not take the offered chair, but leaned on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Higginson spoke to me last night,&rdquo; he said, with visible effort,
      &ldquo;about the family expenses. She thinks they ought to reduce them all
      around, but you, she says, are the only one that knows about it. I
      suggested that she talk it over with you herself; but she didn't want to,
      for some reason.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran swung back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how well you understand this business, Crosman. It simply
      amounts to this: The combine people are selling lumber below cost to run
      us out of business, and we have shut down to let them go ahead until
      they're sick of it. When the price rises we'll start up again. Of course
      all this makes a big difference in Mr. Higginson's income. I suppose
      there's no use trying to make that plain to women, but if you can do
      anything to clear the air you'd better go talk to them. Anyhow, don't let
      them make any difference in their living. We mustn't do anything that will
      scare people; the Higginson credit is good, and it's our business to keep
      it good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He meditated a moment and then looked up and said abruptly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Crosman, you can do me a favour if you want to. Mr.
      Higginson's sickness seems to have left me in charge of his family
      finances. Now suppose you take the whole business off my hands. You know
      both Mrs. Higginson and Miss Higginson better than I do; and I think it
      would be a good deal easier for them to talk things over with you than
      with me. You can let me know if anything special comes up and I'll help
      you work it out. How does that strike you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he managed finally to get out. &ldquo;I'll try it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe this giving away lumber can last much longer,&rdquo; said
      Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something about those phrases that had been floating in Halloran's mind
      for weeks, &ldquo;giving away lumber,&rdquo; &ldquo;selling at a loss,&rdquo; &ldquo;selling to our
      customers,&rdquo; stuck in his thoughts now. He sat there, leaning back in his
      swivel-chair gazing at the rows of pigeon-holes&mdash;Crosman still
      leaning on the desk&mdash;while his mind sailed off to Pewaukoe; he saw
      again the great yards of the Bigelow Company crowded full of lumber&mdash;the
      mills droning ceaselessly, the scores of men swarming over the work, the
      steamer hurrying the cargo&mdash;and he thought again &ldquo;all this is to be
      sold below cost to our customers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Then Halloran's chair came down with a bang and his open hand slapped the
      desk. He had got it. The idea that had evaded him all these weeks was
      finally run to cover, was bagged securely. And the simplicity of it all,
      the feeling of utter imbecility in having failed to see it before, left
      him limp. But he recovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crosman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'm going to Chicago to-night and may not get back
      before the first of the week. You look out for things here, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant was growing hardened to surprises. He merely nodded now,
      with a curious expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had got it. And for a moment he could only say to himself, over
      and over: &ldquo;What a fool! What a fool!&rdquo; He could only think of that
      tremendous output of lumber thrown on the market for a song. &ldquo;Selling to
      our customers, eh,&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;selling to our customers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crosman,&rdquo; he said, when he felt that he was on his legs again, &ldquo;we're
      going to buy lumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman did not grasp it at first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going to buy lumber&mdash;all we can get,&rdquo; Halloran repeated; &ldquo;and
      I'm going down to get the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was sinking into Crosman's head&mdash;slowly he was gripping it, this
      idea of Halloran's. Higgin-son &amp; Company were going to buy lumber,
      were going to buy it below cost&mdash;great quantities of it&mdash;to buy
      it secretly, in many places, under many names, at half the normal price;
      they would sell it later at or above normal. Then at last Crosman looked
      at Halloran and grinned&mdash;broadly, happily. And Halloran said to
      himself again: &ldquo;What a fool! <i>Oh</i>, what a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was much to be done that day. Crosman must have full instructions
      for prompt action; the moment Halloran's message should come up from
      Chicago he must cross the lake to Milwaukee, and from there command the
      Wisconsin shore. Halloran himself would set the Chicago end of the line in
      motion. Scattered here and there around the lake were men who had
      occasionally handled business for Higginson &amp; Company. These were to
      be retained, wherever possible, and set to buying in Trust lumber.
      Everything must be done secretly; every opportunity must be seized. There
      would be storage to arrange for in a dozen cities, and insurance; there
      were a score and odd contingencies to be foreseen and provided against, a
      maximum price to be agreed on for each necessary step. But the figuring
      and the talking had an end; and when Halloran finally jumped on the night
      train and was rolled off toward Chicago he felt that Bigelow's flank was
      as good as turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was one bank in Chicago with which Mr. Higginson had been doing
      business for twenty years. Thither Halloran went, shook hands with the
      cashier and laid bare the situation. The cashier already knew a good deal
      about the fight, and was interested to fill up the gaps in his
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you plan to do, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo; he asked when they had talked
      over the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are going to buy lumber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cashier inclined his head to show that he understood perfectly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can buy it now for one or two dollars less than it costs us to get it
      out of our own woods,&rdquo; Halloran added.
    </p>
    <p>
      This interested the cashier very much indeed. Higginson &amp; Company were
      good, all the way through; and their manager seemed to have a keen
      business sense. Mr. Higginson's sickness entered his calculations; but
      still the investment was sound. The amount must be discussed and one or
      two details mentioned. But it was after a very few minutes of talk that
      the cashier said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We shall be very glad to let you have the money, Mr. Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The arrangements were soon made. Then Hal-loran said good-morning and went
      down to the telegraph office in the basement of the building. And as this
      short message hummed over the wires to Crosman, &ldquo;<i>Go ahead. Halloran</i>,&rdquo;
       he walked out into the street to begin the battle. All idleness was over
      now for Halloran&mdash;all merely defensive work, all waiting for results.
      From now on it was to be straight-out fighting; and he knew that the best
      man would win.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before that Saturday afternoon was far advanced Halloran's agents were at
      work. Their instructions were simple. &ldquo;Buy all the one-inch and two-inch
      stuff you can get, pine and hemlock, in regular lengths and widths,&rdquo; was
      what he had said, in starting them out; and before evening orders had been
      placed in Chicago alone for nearly a million feet. The work would be
      pushed still further on Monday and Tuesday. Every company in the &ldquo;combine&rdquo;
       would be given an opportunity to sell heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Farther up Lake Michigan Crosman was working with equal energy. It was a
      chance for Crosman, an opportunity to show his metal, and he realized it.
      There had been some pulling at odds in the office, and the assistant had
      perhaps been inclined to misunderstand Halloran in more ways than one; but
      all that was now swept away, and the enthusiasm of vigorous work was in
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first time since the fight began he fully understood it; he had
      been made to see that there was a possibility of winning. And when
      Halloran's message reached him that morning and he realized that no
      regular steamer would cross the lake before evening, he hurried a tug into
      commission, and with Captain Craig and MacGregor to get him over he made
      the passage to Milwaukee in less than seven hours. Late as it was when he
      arrived, he not only organized the work for Monday, but succeeded in
      placing the first few orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it fell out that the reduction in price, made solely to ruin
      Higginson, was suddenly and unexpectedly turned to his advantage. The busy
      companies that were scattered about the northern shores of the lake did
      not know this yet&mdash;did not dream that they were crowding extra shifts
      of men into their mills to help out Higginson, that the logs floating down
      a score of rivers in both peninsulas were to be cut for Higginson, that
      the steamers loading at a score of wharves were running for Higginson,
      that the long list of lake towns from which had arisen the heavy demand
      for lumber were buying for Higginson. They did not know these things, and
      Halloran did not mean that they should know them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps it was the knowledge of all this, and the natural elation after
      such a day's work, that between them took Halloran's actions out of his
      own hands that Saturday evening. There were times when he was likely to
      surprise himself; this seemed to be one of them. During these past three
      years he had been in Chicago a number of times, but always only to
      transact his business and go directly back to Wauchung, always heeding
      that stubborn quality somewhere within him that had had so much to do with
      pulling him up from nothing and pushing him on in the world, that had kept
      him out of foolishness on at least one important occasion. He had managed,
      until now, to side with the stubborn quality against a certain impulse
      that had occasionally given him trouble, but to-night the impulse caught
      him off his guard. There were a good many things he might have done&mdash;there
      were even one or two details of the fight still to be studied out&mdash;but
      the impulse, once securely planted in authority, swept aside every other
      thought. And so, after dinner, Halloran caught a train for Evanston.
    </p>
    <p>
      An odd feeling took possession of him when he found himself once more,
      after three years, on the scene of his struggles. It did not seem so long
      ago. That he had greatly changed he knew; since the days of
      furnace-tending, and study, and work as a surfman, and all the other
      interests that had crowded those earlier years, he had thrown himself out
      into the world. He had come to know something of the joy of directing men
      and events, of playing a positive part in the life about him. He had come
      to love the fighting, to love the play of fact upon fact and mind upon
      mind. During the last year he had begun to understand the feeling of the
      trained swimmer when he plunges into deep water. There was the
      exhilaration, not only of keeping afloat where weak men sink, but of
      laying a course and following it, sure of his strength and endurance.
      While this change was taking place in him he had been inclined to forget
      that these three years were, after all, but a ninth or tenth part of his
      life so far, and that the other nine-tenths were also a fact. But
      to-night, as he walked up toward the Ridge where the big houses stood, he
      felt that he was taking up his old life where he had laid it down that day
      when he took the boat for Wauchung. And somehow he was not so sure of
      himself as he had been when he said good-morning to the cashier.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was almost relieved to find that Miss Davies and her mother had stepped
      across the way. They would be back soon, he was told; so he went in, left
      his hat and coat in the hall, and walked in through the parlour to the
      long sitting-room, where there were rows upon rows of books and a
      round-edged table covered with other books and with magazines, and a great
      fireplace with a wood fire burning to take the edge off the evening air.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down in the Morris chair by the table and picked up a book&mdash;he
      had not had time to read much of late years. But after a moment of turning
      the pages the book was lowered to his knees and his eyes looked over it at
      the fire. There had been a time when he had laid that fire regularly every
      morning, and now to be sitting here, suddenly conscious that his life had
      taken a new direction, that he was older, and that his clothes were better&mdash;that
      he was, in fact, another person altogether&mdash;was odd and haunting, was
      almost disconcerting.
    </p>
    <p>
      He heard the front door open. There was a rustle out in the hall, and
      voices. He let his head fall against the back of his chair and turned his
      face toward the parlour door. He hardly knew what to make of himself; he
      was almost afraid he had emotions. Certainly a peculiar disturbance was
      going on somewhere within him, such a disturbance as hardly could be
      looked for within the manager of a lumber company. He did not like it at
      all. He wondered why she was so long about coming in. Perhaps she would go
      on upstairs, not knowing he was there; and that would be awkward.
      Altogether, it was probably a good thing that Halloran had come out to
      Evanston before the new life had succeeded in withdrawing him finally from
      the old, before the proportion of one-tenth to nine-tenths had been evened
      up and he had wholly changed into Michigan lumber&mdash;a very good thing
      indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in through the hall doorway and paused surprised. He felt himself
      rising and standing with his back to the table and the light. She came
      slowly forward, inclining her head a little to get the light out of her
      eyes so that she could see his face. The disturbance, now increasing in
      that strange new part of him, out of all proportion to the occasion,
      called his attention to her reserve, to the something&mdash;was it pride?&mdash;that
      had disturbed him in other days; it taunted him with her firm carriage,
      her fine, thoughtful face; it reminded him of her real superiority, the
      superiority that comes only from pride in right living; and so Halloran,
      the vigorous, the elated, at the moment of greeting an old friend in her
      own house, was so far from equal to the situation that for the life of him
      he could think of nothing but certain raw facts in his own bringing-up, or
      fighting-up, whichever it might be called. And not a word did he say&mdash;simply
      waited.

      She came a few steps nearer and hesitated. Then, after an instant, her
      whole expression changed. Her eyes lighted up with gladness so real that
      even he could not misread it; and she came rapidly forward with
      outstretched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, John Halloran,&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;where did you come from?&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;The Question
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e took her hand,
      and their eyes met. Until now it had not occurred to him that she, too,
      had changed. Her expression even was different; three years earlier she
      had been living earnestly, intensely&mdash;she had felt the unequal
      burdens of the world and had plunged fearlessly into vast problems, but
      now she seemed more impersonal, more detached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down,&rdquo; she said, withdrawing her hand. &ldquo;I will speak to mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were more greetings to be gone through. They sat about the fire for
      awhile; and Halloran had to give an account of himself, and had to listen
      to Mrs. Davies's open approval of him. She had heard of him now and then;
      she had known from the first that he would get on; she was downright proud
      of him, in fact. This was something of an ordeal, and he felt relieved
      when she withdrew and left Margaret with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two stood for a moment looking into the fire; then she nodded toward
      the Morris chair and he dropped into it. She sat down on the other side of
      the table and propped up her chin on her two hands. For a moment they sat
      looking at each other. Finally they both smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she observed, &ldquo;we've been growing up, haven't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So she had remarked it, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I guess we have,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Rather more than I had thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't expect to find me the same girl you left here, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran gazed moodily into the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I couldn't say just what I did expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's different, anyway, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And now you don't like it because you think we shall have to begin all
      over again getting acquainted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded again. Then, looking up, he was assured by her friendly smile.
      She slowly shook her head at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't quite fair,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;Here I have been staying right at
      home and doing the same things all these three years. If I have grown a
      little older, I couldn't help it very well. But you have grown to be a
      business man with ever so many interests, and I suppose you are very
      successful&mdash;anyway, you have changed so much I hardly knew you. How
      long are you going to be here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Until Monday or Tuesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must come to dinner to-morrow, then. You'd better come planning to
      spend the rest of the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks, I will. How is George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face grew serious. &ldquo;He has been giving me a good deal of trouble
      lately. I don't know what to make of him. He lost his home, you know&mdash;or
      maybe you don't. Have you heard the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a strange one. To begin with, his sister Elizabeth eloped with Mr.
      Le Duc.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;Yes; they were married in St. Joe, and she went on the stage with him.
      Jimmie McGinnis is with them, too. They call themselves the three Le Ducs,
      I believe. And Mrs. Craig lost her position. The Le Ducs are in Chicago
      now, at a cheap theatre, and Mrs. Craig is living with them; but they
      refused to take George, too. They seem to grudge her even the little they
      do. So George was turned out into the street and got into bad company, and
      now he's in jail. I don't think it's as bad as it sounds. His companions
      are a good deal older, and Mr. Babcock, who has been looking after him,
      says he will undoubtedly be released. I almost wrote you about it a little
      while ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I didn't know&mdash;it has been so long.&rdquo; She
      looked up. &ldquo;To tell the truth, I didn't know whether you were still
      interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and went over to the mantel. The fire was low and he heaped it up
      with the largest sticks in the wood-box; then dropping on one knee he took
      up the bellows and had it roaring in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like a big fire,&rdquo; he said, over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded and let her eyes rest on him as he worked over the fire. Yes,
      he was a good deal older; his frame had filled out and settled; and in his
      manner, too, some of the rough edges had been rubbed down&mdash;a fact she
      whimsically regretted. She got up now and pushed the big chair up beside
      the fire and sat across from him. For a time they said nothing&mdash;he
      sitting on a stool at one side of the hearth, she in the chair at the
      other; he applying the bellows in a moody, desultory way, she leaning back
      watching first him and then the leaping flames. Finally he said, letting
      the bellows swing between his knees, still keeping his eyes on the fire:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She started a little and a quick, almost shy glance shot from her eyes;
      but he seemed wholly unconscious that he had never directly called her by
      that name before. He swung the bellows slowly to and fro like a pendulum.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What made you think I wouldn't be interested?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;I don't know that I meant exactly that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on, still without looking up: &ldquo;Was it anything in what I wrote
      before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there had been some writing before&mdash;when he was first at
      Wauchung, and she, eager for her little protégé in the city, had kept him
      informed of George's progress and had relied on his counsel. And now, as
      he brought that correspondence up in his mind, and remembered how it had
      bothered him, how he had avoided every personal reference and had made it
      easy always for her to stop when she chose, and how she finally had
      stopped&mdash;when he had these facts before him, he was thankful that the
      fire could partly explain his colour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I wasn't a very satisfactory correspondent,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;but
      those weren't very satisfactory days. I was sailing pretty close then&mdash;I
      had some college expenses to pay back, and I was learning the business,
      and altogether I didn't see much fun in living. If you have thought of me
      since as the same sort of fellow I was then, I don't blame you for not
      wanting to write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked up at her for a reply; but she only smiled a little and slowly
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so they talked on, these two, for a long time; they drifted on into a
      dreamy, personal mood&mdash;into a land where only common interests could
      get a footing, where there was no clock&mdash;nothing but the red flames,
      and the dim rows of books, and the hushed house, and themselves. They
      forgot to-night those three years of divergence&mdash;forgot that there
      was one set of facts centring about the Michigan lumberman and another
      about Margaret. To Halloran all of life had slipped away except that
      dreamy figure in the Morris chair, with the late red glow of the fire on
      her face and on her hair. Her eyes were half closed, and she turned them
      toward him now and then without moving her head. A smile hovered on her
      face&mdash;now on her lips, if he spoke to her&mdash;at other times
      flitting about her eyes. Her hands lay motionless on the arms of 'the
      chair. To both of them it was a rich glad time, so glad that it could best
      be explained by silence, tempered only at intervals by low voices; so rich
      that it poured its warmth into their very souls and quieted them, and gave
      them to know that such high moments are rare, that they must be conserved
      and guarded, must be lived through reverently.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her shyly at first, with stolen glances, until in some silent
      way she gave him her permission; and then he looked long, not from his
      eyes alone, but from the new self within him which had risen almost to
      equality with that other self of hers. He knew this now&mdash;knew it to
      be gloriously true; and he felt a defiance of all life, of all the
      pressing facts and things that had crowded into his existence, a defiance,
      a consciousness of self that thrilled him with its reality. For the first
      time in his life he knew that those solid things were not real. And his
      soul was awed and humbled.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she looked at him&mdash;shyly always, yet conscious of what she was
      too honest to deny. And the occasional pressure of her sensitive mouth,
      the twitch of her eyelid as the light wavered over it, were not needed to
      show him that she, too, was wholly given up to the reality&mdash;that her
      life was gathered up to-night, with his, into one full hour of happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Into this Arden came the distant whistle of a locomotive. Her eyes sought
      his, and at the expression they found there she shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is going the other way,&rdquo; she said softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry&rdquo;&mdash;he looked at his watch&mdash;&ldquo;I have just time for the
      last train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose and stood a moment looking at the fire. Then he came over and
      leaned on the back of the chair and reached down and raised her hand in
      his. She almost shivered at his touch, but he held it firmly; and after a
      moment, in which the blood seemed to leave her face, her fingers closed on
      his and clasped them tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      And then he forgot all about the last train. He knew that the impulse that
      he had feared so long had at last mastered him, and he was wildly,
      exultantly glad. He slipped down on the broad arm of the chair and held
      her hand on his knee, and looked down at her hair; whilst she, still with
      that occasional compression of the lips, gazed into the fire. For her,
      too, everything had slipped into oblivion&mdash;everything but the red,
      red glow of the dying fire and the clasp of his hand in hers and the touch
      of his other hand on her hair. There was nothing else in the world for her
      to-night; and her happiness was so poignant that she felt herself swept
      blindly along with him, past all the obstacles of convention, of small
      misunderstandings, of outside interests, on up to heights that had never
      before during her quiet lifetime even entered her imagination. At moments
      her fingers would tighten on his and strange, happy tears would fill her
      eyes, to be kept back only by an effort. Once she could not keep them
      back; and he looked down and saw them on her cheek, and she did not care.
      Tears were trivial, now that her soul was laid bare to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At another time she spoke so softly that he could not hear, and he bent
      down his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to try to get back to the city?&rdquo; she repeated, in a
      voice from which all strength, all the body had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I'm going down to the hotel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her clasp tightened again by way of reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so the wild, sweet message came to this man and this young woman. It
      told them how deeply those earlier years of friendship had entered their
      natures; it let them know how much stronger it was than will or habit&mdash;how
      it had chained their two lives so firmly together that only a few moments
      had been needed to-night to show it plainly to them both. A look of the
      eye, a tone in the voice, and it was done. From that moment their lives
      had changed; and where-ever the new current might lead them, whatever
      might be waiting in the dim, luminous years beyond, the new fact must
      control their thoughts. The old days were gone; the new had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Was it strange that he should think of this, that the meaning of it all
      should flash through his mind; whilst she, with her sensitive nature
      wholly bound up in this moment, should be thinking of nothing, should be
      conscious of nothing, save that he was here? Was this strange? Her eyes
      were still fixed on the embers; she seemed unable to raise them to his. In
      all her life she had never before given up. Her impulses had never before
      swept her reason from its seat and held her, trembling and amazed, in
      their grip. It was new and wonderful to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said, in the low voice that expressed the most, &ldquo;dare I
      look at my watch?&rdquo; She smiled and tightly held his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught up a lock of her hair and held it against the light. It
      glistened like fine-spun gold. He leaned down and pressed it to his lips;
      and again he felt that tightening of her fingers, that slight shiver
      passing through her. He bent forward and saw that the tears had escaped
      again. &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;look up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes lifted a little, then dropped. He waited and then whispered
      again, &ldquo;Look up, dear.&rdquo; Slowly she raised them until they met his fairly,
      and their two souls were gazing straight, each to each. Her fingers
      tightened and tightened; she was trembling. And at last he caught her
      wildly with both his arms and drew her against him and kissed her
      forehead, her eyes, her mouth. And her tears fell without restraint.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; he whispered, his mouth close to her ear, &ldquo;Dear girl, you
      love me&mdash;I know you love me. I have waited&mdash;it is a long while
      that I have waited&mdash;but all the waiting is over now. Tell me that it
      is all over&mdash;that we are going to begin our lives&mdash;our life&mdash;new
      again. Tell me that we are going to be happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a moment during which she struggled to free herself. &ldquo;Don't, oh,
      don't!&rdquo; she cried brokenly. &ldquo;Please stop, John!&rdquo; And he, hurt and
      wondering, released her, and stood up, watching her stupidly as she fell
      back in the chair and covered her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Halloran! He had been supposing that he understood her&mdash;that he
      really could see a little way into that complex nature. And the discovery
      that he was still far on the outside of her personality brought a cruel
      shock. He could not know that while his thoughts had rambled ahead,
      constructing their life, hers had been absorbed in the happiness of that
      one golden hour. He could not understand how his words, and the
      realization of what this evening meant to them both, had burst upon her
      with a force that frightened her. He could not be expected to know what a
      struggle had come with this first open thought of giving herself up to a
      man&mdash;what questions it raised, what problems of wholly reconstructing
      a life; how the great question loomed before her in dimensions that seemed
      almost tragic. He could not understand this; and so, when he finally
      spoke, it was with a touch of quiet dignity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I have asked you to be my wife.&rdquo; There was a more
      and more appealing quality in his voice as he went on. &ldquo;I have asked you
      to be my wife. Can't you give me your answer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head without uncovering her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I come for it to-morrow, then, Margaret? I think I have told you
      everything. You know that I love you. I can't live without you&mdash;I
      dread even to think of waiting. It means so much to me, Margaret, so very
      much, that I don't know&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, for his voice was beginning to shake a little. Still she was
      silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&rdquo;&mdash;it was getting difficult to speak&mdash;&ldquo;have you nothing
      to tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, John,&rdquo; she managed to say, &ldquo;I'm sorry! I'm so sorry!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is that all, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not come to-morrow&mdash;I can't let you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week, then, Margaret?&mdash;a&mdash;a month?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;you must not stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He waited a little, then walked slowly to the hall. When he had his coat
      nearly on she came to the doorway. He waited again, hat in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;good-night,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is that&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head nervously, hurriedly, and he opened the door and went
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when he had gone, when his last step had died away in the still air,
      she sank down on the stairs and sobbed, trembling in the power of this
      passion. What had she done! What had she done! Her thoughts ranged madly.
      She thought of the three years of divergence; of his habits, of hers; of
      all the things, great and trivial, that bore on the question; she tried to
      remember what had happened this night, and could not. She only knew that
      this strange power had mastered her; and she was afraid of it and of him.

      CHAPTER X&mdash;A Letter
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>r. Bigelow sat in
      the chair: behind and around him were the speakers of the evening, grouped
      with the Committee of the Society of the Preservation of the Home; before
      him extended rows upon rows of citizens, all of them vigorously applauding
      the last speaker, all of them, without regard to private cellars, bent
      upon stamping out the saloon evil in their suburb.
    </p>
    <p>
      An usher mounted the platform and laid a folded slip of paper on the
      table. The Chairman unfolded it, read it with great composure, and
      inclined his head to signify an affirmative reply. This was the note:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Dear Sir:</i> May I see you for a few moments after the meeting, on
      business of great importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Appleton Le Duc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably a reporter,&rdquo; thought the Chairman. A draft of his opening speech
      lay in his inside pocket, and if this man was attached to a reputable
      paper he would be welcome to it. Mr. Bigelow made it an invariable rule to
      be courteous to newspaper men.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the meeting, therefore, as he was donning his coat, the
      usher touched him on the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the man who wished to see you, Mr. Bigelow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Chairman turned and beheld a tall, thin individual, with a long face,
      wearing somewhat conspicuous clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; he said, in a genial tone, extending his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The thin man took it and glanced sharply at Mr. Bigelow&mdash;a glance
      full of curious interest. A change had been taking place in Apples since
      we last saw him. Evidently the care of his wife and his wife's mother, and
      the prospect of a visit from the stork at once reducing the family income
      and materially increasing the outgo, had quieted the effervescence of his
      youth and set him thinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you have no objection,&rdquo; said Le Duc, &ldquo;I will walk along with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;None whatever,&rdquo; replied Mr. Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked together out of the building and followed that part of the
      crowd which had turned westward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; observed, the Chairman, &ldquo;what can I do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Le Due answered in a low, even voice&mdash;a voice which, if it showed
      embarrassment and effort, showed also determination.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were formerly married, I believe, to a woman who is now known as Mrs.
      Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dwelling, as it had been, on the plaudits, the hearty enthusiasms of the
      evening, on the written speech reposing in an inside pocket, Mr. Bigelow's
      mind came to earth with a shock. He stopped abruptly, threw a quick look
      at the thin man, and then, recalling that the sidewalk was still covered
      with people, he moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you come here to discuss my private affairs?&rdquo; he said brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In a sense, yes. The matter has been put into my hands, and I thought the
      most satisfactory thing would be to come out here and talk to you. Of
      course, if you'd rather I'd see somebody else, it makes no difference to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow was silent for a moment. Le Due glanced sideways at him as
      they passed under a corner light, and was glad to observe that he had
      penetrated the man's armour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you a lawyer?&rdquo; was the Chairman's abrupt question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In what capacity have you come here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see, Lizzie, Mrs. Craig's daughter, is my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow's reply was a half-audible grunt. &ldquo;Mrs. Craig, you understand,
      is really suffering. She has no income and we have been keeping her with
      us; but I am not in a position to do much for her&mdash;not as much as I
      should like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you want of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe&mdash;that you agreed to support her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, how much do you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't it, you see.&rdquo; Somewhat eagerly this. &ldquo;It wasn't only that you
      agreed to support her, but the courts decided that you should. So it isn't
      a question of what you might offer or me accept, but of how much is owing
      on past years. I think I can understand it&mdash;I suppose a man gets
      tired of paying out money he doesn't get any return for&mdash;and of
      course it's been a good many years&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;you see&mdash;I've thought there was some misunderstanding
      about the business. She says you told her to go to law if she wanted to,
      but I thought she must have misunderstood you. Of course, she could, you
      know, but her case is very good, I think. It would be expensive all
      'round; and it mightn't be pleasant.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Very true, Apples. It might be decidedly unpleasant, now that a voluble
      young man, with apparently no regard for the proprieties, has sprung up
      from nowhere to push matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what <i>do</i> you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've talked it all over with Mrs. Craig and she has told me just how
      things stand. She has kept a pretty regular account of everything; and she
      figures it out about like this. There were five years, nearly five, anyhow&mdash;we
      don't want to quibble over that&mdash;when she was to all intents and
      purposes paid up. Since then there haven't been any regular payments,
      except about five hundred dollars that's been given her in small sums. It
      was to be a thousand dollars a year, I believe. Five thousand five hundred
      from seventeen thousand leaves eleven thousand five hundred still due her&mdash;call
      it an even eleven thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you are not a lawyer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is your business?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm&mdash;I'm an actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you play?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the North Side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can you earn?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, the three of us&mdash;we are the three Le Ducs, you know&mdash;my
      wife and I, and Elmer, can get sixty a week for our turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean to say you have a son old enough to play with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, no&mdash;we only call him Elmer Le Duc. We haven't been married
      so long as that. But&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; However, this was not business, and
      he checked the confidence that was never far from the end of his tongue
      nowadays.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long have you been on the stage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you do before that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was at college.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, in Evanston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were now standing in front of the wide grounds of G. Hyde Bigelow.
      Peeping out from its screen of trees, far back behind the spacious lawn,
      could be seen the granite turrets of Mr. Bigelow's new house. The owner
      turned toward them as he reflected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will tell you what you do, Mr.&mdash;Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Duc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Le Duc. You come to my office to-morrow at eleven. I think that by
      that time I will have a proposition that will interest you. Meantime,
      suppose we let this matter stand just where it is now. Is that
      satisfactory?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;certainly; perfectly so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, I shall look for you to-morrow at eleven. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe I had better leave one of my cards with you, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow turned into the grounds and disappeared among the trees, and
      Apples, bubbling with self-congratulations, hurried over to the trolley
      line.

      Margaret was tired to-night. She was glad to be at home; and she threw
      herself on the library couch to rest for an hour while she awaited the
      final report of the day's labours. For George had been released from jail,
      thanks to the benevolence of the judge&mdash;himself a suburbanite&mdash;and
      to the clearness of the facts. It had called for very little effort on the
      part of Mr. Babcock, who had taken the case on his own shoulders, to make
      plain that George had been merely the cat's-paw of a gang of roughs. And
      now Mrs. Bigelow had promised Mr. Babcock that she would take in the boy
      and give him work about the house; so that apparently he was at last to
      have a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length Mr. Babcock himself came in. He was almost jaunty this evening;
      and his voice was pitched higher than usual.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Miss Davies?&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Here I am with my report.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You brought him out, did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Mrs. Bigelow has him and promises to take the best of care of him.
      He seems a likely boy&mdash;unfortunate he wasn't better brought up. But
      of course he may take a brace&mdash;such things have happened.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I have faith in George,&rdquo; said Margaret warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I hope you're right. Maybe you are. He'll be kept busy for
      awhile anyway, learning to groom the horses and milk the cows. That'll be
      good for him. Queer case, isn't it. Quite like a story. It has interested
      me immensely. Been a queer sort of day all around for me. If every day was
      like it I'd never get any business done. Came right in a busy season, too.
      Oh, I don't mean about the boy. That was because you were interested in
      him. I'd do as much any time you asked it&mdash;do it gladly. But I ran
      across Myers while I was over at the court building. He is going West, you
      know, for his wife's health, and wants to sell his house. You know it,
      don't you?&mdash;over on the Lake Front. He wants to sell bad and offers
      the place for next to nothing, so I promised him I'd stroll down there
      to-night and have a look at it. How would you like to go along? Your
      taste's rather better than mine, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;isn't it a little late?&rdquo; He had never talked like this before;
      she was puzzled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not so very&mdash;about nine. But I see you're tired, so don't
      think of it. Tell you what I'll do&mdash;I'll get him to let me have the
      plans, and we'll look them over together, and you tell me how they strike
      you. If it is in as good shape as I think I believe I'll buy&mdash;that
      is, if I can get a clear title.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very attractive along the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way it strikes me. And with good horses you'd hardly mind the
      distance. He says his library is finished in rose tints and Flemish oak.
      How does that sound?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very pretty, I should think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, doesn't it? So you really like the idea? I'm glad of that. You're
      the one I care most about pleasing.&rdquo; He rose and looked down at her.
      &ldquo;There's no use telling me you aren't tired: I can see it. You've worked
      like a good one to-day, and I'm going to let you get a little rest.&rdquo; She
      rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll bring up the plans sometime before Sunday, and we'll go over them
      and see what we make of it. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled wearily and stood there until he had left the house; then she
      went upstairs and into Mrs. Davies's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she said, with an odd little smile, &ldquo;I want to go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;-East, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Davies looked quietly up from her knitting. &ldquo;'How long have you been
      thinking of this?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not very long&mdash;just to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They looked at each other for a moment in that same quiet way&mdash;Margaret
      still smiling, but with a suspicious shine in her eyes. Then suddenly she
      came over, slipped to the floor, and buried her face on her arms in her
      mother's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a long silence Mrs. Davies asked:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When would you like to go, dear?&rdquo; There was no reply. &ldquo;Very soon?&rdquo;
       Margaret raised her head a little way and was apparently about to speak,
      then lowered it again. &ldquo;Would you like to go this week?&rdquo; Still there was
      silence. But Mrs. Davies seemed to understand. &ldquo;We might get away by
      Thursday or Friday, dearie, if you can get ready. Can you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Margaret murmured, without looking up: &ldquo;Oh, yes, yes! I can be ready
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As time went by the wisdom of Halloran's method of buying lumber became
      apparent. If the orders had not gone in almost simultaneously to the
      offices of the different companies the directors would probably have put
      their heads together and declined meeting such an unusually heavy demand.
      As it fell out, however, when the heads did finally go together, it was
      discovered that the mischief had been done, that nearly six million feet
      of lumber had been sold, in thirty or forty different lots, and for about
      $50,000 less than it would have brought at the normal rates. The
      possibility of speculators buying in the lumber had been discussed from
      the first; but the directors had not dreamed that such a movement could be
      actually completed before they could know it was going on. And then they
      found that each of the twenty odd companies had been pledged to these
      orders through its own authorized agents. Even now, after the door had
      been closed on an empty stable, it was not plain what per cent, of the
      sales had gone to speculators; for nearly every order had come from a
      regular dealer in one of a score of different cities and towns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran soon found it difficult to buy, except in occasional small lots.
      His instructions to his agents still held good, however; and he hoped to
      increase his stock until he should have enough on hand to make good all
      the losses resulting from the fight. That was his idea&mdash;to make
      Bigelow pay the bills. Once this point was reached he would show his hand
      by bringing all the lumber to Wauchung.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this stage of the fight there was a pause. On one hand Halloran's
      countermove was practically ended; on the other, the Bigelow forces
      appeared as determined as ever to keep down prices and force Higginson out
      of business. Rumours were floating now and then, to be sure, that there
      was trouble in Kentucky Coal, but there was nothing at all definite. .
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning in the office&mdash;a nearly idle morning, as came about
      frequently now&mdash;Crosman remarked casually over his paper:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's a big fight on in corn on the Board of Trade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something new, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. It seems the secret has just leaked out. A man named Le Duc&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Le Duc!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;Appleton Le Duc&mdash;sounds like a Frenchman, doesn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran left his chair and came over to Cros-man's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;May I see it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly; take it, if you like. I'm through with it. It's a queer
      story.&rdquo; He went on talking while Halloran was reading. &ldquo;It seems he's a
      new man at the business, but they're calling him the new Com King already.
      They say he shows a regular genius for it. It looks as if he was going to
      corner the market. The paper says he used to be an actor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran laid down the paper and perched himself on the corner of
      Crosman's flat-top desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's queer business,&rdquo; he observed. &ldquo;The last time I heard of Apples he
      was playing at a third-class variety house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend of yours?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew him in college. If the paper weren't so sure about it, I'd say it
      was a mistake. He never did it himself&mdash;he hasn't any money, to begin
      with. Somebody's using him for a cat's-paw, plain enough; but I'd like to
      know how the Moses he ever got hold of a snap like that?&rdquo; Halloran shook
      his head over it. &ldquo;Do you ever read Mark Twain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have&mdash;some.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the story of the bad little boy that got rich and went to
      Congress, and died universally respected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never read that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it makes me think of Apples. The two poorest skates we had in
      college are turning out about the same way. The other fellow was a lazy
      beggar from down in Indiana. Came up to college to play baseball, but he
      didn't have grit enough to make the team. He never got anywhere in his
      work&mdash;spent three years in his fourth year Academy, I believe, before
      he gave it up. And no one ever knew how he lived. But one of the directors
      of a big steel company used to live out there, and this fellow scraped up
      money enough to buy a dress suit and join the local club, and took to
      playing billiards and drinking with the director's son, and finally got
      invited around to meet the family. Now he's the assistant secretary of the
      steel company, and has announced his engagement to the director's
      daughter. Enough to make you wonder a little sometimes, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The office door opened, just then, so abruptly that they both started.
      Looking up, they saw Captain Craig standing in the doorway, hatless,
      holding an open letter in his hand. He looked straight at Halloran as if
      he saw nothing else in the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see you,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the odd sound of his voice, Crosman got up without a word and brushed
      by him into the outer office, gently pushing the door to behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, Captain,&rdquo; said Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain took the chair by the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I went up to the house to see the Old Gentleman, but they wouldn't let me
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he is not allowed to see anybody. Will I do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craig seemed not to hear the reply. &ldquo;I got a letter just now&mdash;and I
      wondered if I couldn't get away for a little while&mdash;I guess I won't
      be needed on the steamer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a letter this morning&mdash;I didn't know as I read it straight&mdash;I
      haven't got my glasses with me&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; It seemed difficult for him
      to speak naturally, and he paused, staring at a glass paper-weight on the
      desk. His seamed, harsh old face was working. &ldquo;My God! Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; he
      broke out, &ldquo;I don't hardly dare believe it! Here, read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran took the letter and read what follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Father</i>: I have waited a long, long time, and now I'm tired and I
      want to come home. You were right always&mdash;it was all a mistake. Now
      when I look back there are some parts of it that are like dreams to me. Do
      you think you could forgive me? Do you think you could let me come back
      and take care of your house for you?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was all wrong, but I am older now&mdash;I have a girl of my own who has
      grown up and married&mdash;and I think I could understand better. I can
      imagine better, too, how you have suffered&mdash;how I have made you
      suffer&mdash;and now that there are times when my life seems clouded and
      unreal&mdash;some days and weeks even, when I look back I can hardly
      remember what I have said or done, or how I have lived&mdash;when I think
      of this, and think how my life seems to be slipping away from me, a little
      at a time, I feel that I just must come back to you. Of course, nothing
      can be undone, nothing can be lived over. I know that bitterly now&mdash;I
      feel it all the time, and especially at night when I lie awake and all
      these years come whirling up in my mind and confuse me and discourage me.
      But I have tried not to grow bitter. I have been hungry a good many times,
      and cold, and haven't had much to wear, but I have tried always to
      remember that the only way out is just the patient, honest way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There may not be many years left to us, but wouldn't it be better to try
      to make them happy years? You see I'm writing as if I felt you had already
      forgiven me&mdash;I can't help it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Elizabeth is married, as I told you, and hasn't room for me any more.
      But, George is not a bad boy&mdash;you will like George, father, I know.
      And perhaps he will grow up into something better than I and make you feel
      yet that it was worth while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is nineteen years to-day since you brought me down here on the old <i>Number
      One</i>&mdash;do you remember? I have never forgotten how you looked when
      you stood on the bridge and waved good-by. Well, my married life was not
      what I thought it would be, but somehow now, while I am writing this, it
      seems almost as if I could cut this long part of my life right out, and
      take up the first part again where I left it off that day. You will find
      me changed&mdash;I am getting to be quite an old woman&mdash;if all goes
      well, I may be a grandmother before the year is gone. Think of that!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father, I don't know what I am thinking of to be writing like this,
      when I ought to be down on my knees to you. But I can't help it. Can you
      forgive me, and let me begin again?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jennie Craig.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran gazed at the letter until the silence grew oppressive and then he
      looked out the window. Craig was still staring at the paperweight; and
      when he finally spoke it was without shifting his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was only eighteen when she went down to Chicago to work for Bigelow.
      She didn't know any better&mdash;G. Hyde Bigelow wasn't above marrying his
      clerk in those days. And then she found him out and got a divorce; and
      I've never heard since, until to-day. I guess&mdash;I guess there's a
      little pride in our family&mdash;she's never written&mdash;and I haven't.
      But, oh, God! Mr. Halloran&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran turned at the exclamation, and then, with such a sense of
      helplessness as he had never before known, he lowered his eyes. For the
      Captain was crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going right down there,&rdquo; the broken voice went on. &ldquo;Have you a
      time-table here?&rdquo; Halloran fumbled in his drawer, found the time-table,
      looked over the train schedule, marked the right column with his pencil
      and laid it before the Captain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is that? Ten-thirty?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; ten-thirty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's in about an hour. Well, then, I suppose&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; He made as
      if to rise, but settled back again. Finally Halloran spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I know your daughter, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I saw her several times a few years ago. I can tell you a good deal
      about George, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a good girl. We used to think she took after me a little. I think
      maybe&mdash;I think I'll bring her right back with me to-night or
      tomorrow; and then you can come around and see us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. What would you say if I were to go down with you, Captain. Perhaps I
      could help you find her and George.&rdquo; He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;We'll bring
      the boy back, too. I guess we can manage to keep him busy around the
      office until the mills start up again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know how old he is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George must be about sixteen, I should say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the girl is married&mdash;she must be older&mdash;I guess I'm a
      little bewildered.&rdquo; He got up now and stood silent by the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be ready for you in half an hour, Captain.&rdquo; There seemed to be
      nothing more to say; and after another silence Craig went out. But later,
      during the hours on the train, Halloran had to tell over and over what he
      knew about George and Lizzie, their mother, and Le Duc.

      CHAPTER XI&mdash;High Life at the Le Ducs
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen at last they
      were on the cable-car, north bound, Craig broke the silence that had held
      through the latter half of the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose we could get them all together to-night&mdash;the boy, and
      the girl and her husband? We could have a supper somewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. It will be a little late before I can get George back from
      Evanston&mdash;half-past eight or nine o'clock, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain winced at the words. He knew now that George was a charity boy
      in the home of his own father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would like to set it for half-past eight, I will see Le Duc and
      then go out for George.&rdquo; The Captain, whose head was in no condition for
      planning even so much as a supper, accepted this arrangement without a
      word. They were silent again until they left the car.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if she'll know me,&rdquo; Craig mused, as they walked along, &ldquo;I ain't
      the same as I was then&mdash;it's a long time, Mr. Halloran, a long time.
      She was a pretty girl&mdash;always had a laugh for one&mdash;I've often
      thought of her energy and nerve. She had a way of going at things, I tell
      you. When she got a notion she ought to earn her own living there couldn't
      anything stop her. Are we getting near it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a little way now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. It's queer how long a day can be&mdash;and after most twenty
      years, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the door Halloran paused. It was in a mean street, meaner even than the
      old quarters near Hoffman's saloon, and the stairs leading up to the
      living-rooms above were crowded in between a cheap restaurant and a much
      less respectable saloon than Hoffman's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Captain, I'll leave you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;aren't you coming in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I haven't any too much time. I know Le Duc's address&mdash;I read it
      in the paper this morning. We will meet here at half-past eight.&rdquo; Craig
      was about to protest, but Halloran hurried off; and the Captain started
      alone up the stairway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Le Ducs were living at an apartment hotel not far from the Lake Shore
      Drive. From the appearance of the building and the neighbourhood Halloran
      inferred that the corn market was proving a profitable field for Apples.
      He inquired for him and was taken up in the elevator and shown into a neat
      little parlour on an upper floor, commanding a view of the lake. Being
      received by a maid in a cap and apron, he repeated his inquiry, only to
      learn that Mr. Le Duc was not at home&mdash;had not yet returned from his
      office. Could he see Mrs. Le Duc? The maid hesitated. But as time was
      pressing, he persisted. Would she please tell her mistress that Mr.
      Halloran had come with an important message from Mrs. Le Duc's mother and
      grandfather. The maid turned away and had nearly crossed the room when she
      was intercepted by a loud whisper from behind the double doors of the next
      room:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ask him to wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Halloran sat down and looked at the photographs of actors and actresses
      that crowded the walls&mdash;prominent among which were large prints of
      Appleton Le Duc and Elizabeth Le Duc and Elmer Le Duc&mdash;until Apples
      himself, wearing a prosperous air, better dressed, but still dapper, still
      with a flash somewhere in his get-up, opened the door, and Halloran rose
      to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How&mdash;how are you? Oh, this must be Halloran. I knew you at college.
      How are you? What can I do for you? Sit down, Halloran. Excuse me a minute
      while I take off my coat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apples disappeared into the next room, and as the door closed behind him
      there was an audible smack, followed by whispering. He shortly returned
      with a puzzled expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me for keeping you waiting, Halloran. There are so many claims on
      me these days that I can't get away from my office as early as I'd like.
      Now tell me what I can do for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is a long story, Apples&rdquo;&mdash;the Corn King seemed to dislike the
      word&mdash;&ldquo;but you'll hear it all soon enough. What it amounts to is,
      that Mrs. Craig's father, who is a steamer captain, is working for the
      same company that employs me, and&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're a sailor now, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see, you went in for that sort of thing a good deal in the old
      days, didn't you? Weren't you on the Life-Saving Crew at college?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I was. Captain Craig has come down here to take Mrs. Craig back home
      with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you don't say so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he would like you and Mrs. Le Duc to meet him and Mrs. Craig at her
      rooms to-night and take supper with them&mdash;at half-past eight. I'm
      going out now for George.&rdquo; He rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you, Halloran&rdquo;&mdash;Apples had risen, too, and was
      speaking in a low, confidential voice&mdash;&ldquo;between ourselves, my wife
      isn't going out much now, and I'm afraid we can't do it. We'd like to very
      much, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again came the whisper from behind the door. &ldquo;Appleton!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, dearie. Excuse me a second, Halloran.&rdquo; He slipped out again and
      there was more whispering. When he returned it was to say: &ldquo;My wife would
      be very glad to have you all come here instead. We will have the supper up
      here in our apartment. Tell them we'll be very glad to see them&mdash;and
      you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. I'll tell them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apples showed him out, and as he left the building and headed for the
      State Street trolley he found himself thinking much of Apples and his rise
      in life.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he was on the Evanston train, however, he had something else to think
      about. In order to get George he must go either to the Bigelows' home or
      to Margaret's. Not one of the letters he had written since that evening
      had been answered. Besides, he was not in the right frame of mind to see
      her&mdash;or he thought he was not, which amounted to the same thing. All
      day he had been deep in the trouble of the Craig family, and in his talk
      about coming out after George he had not taken time to think just how he
      was to manage it. But he was realizing it now as he left the train and
      started up toward the Ridge; and as this is to be an honest history, the
      facts of what followed must be told.
    </p>
    <p>
      Half-way up from the station, while he was walking briskly along, boasting
      inwardly that he was calm and ready to see Margaret, his legs, without
      warning him, turned him off on a side street. When he had rounded the
      block, and had convinced himself that now he was headed straight for the
      Ridge, they deceived him again. This was humiliating, and, more, was not
      the way to march to victory. Twice he walked around the square, but the
      third time, by a strong effort, he succeeded in passing the fatal corner.
      Soon he could see the house a little way ahead. It occurred to him that he
      was rushing along at an absurd speed, and he walked more slowly. A moment
      more and he was in front of the house, was turning in up the walk&mdash;but,
      no, he was mistaken; for the legs, suddenly out of all control, carried
      him by and nearly a block farther up the street before he could check them
      and get them headed straight. He found he could manage them better by
      stepping once on each square of the cement walk, squarely in the middle
      each time; and he could keep this up by giving all his mind to it. This
      made it necessary to take rather long steps, but the twilight was
      deepening, and, besides, there were few other pedestrians on the street.
      Again he drew near. He looked up at the windows&mdash;they were dark,
      excepting a light in the rear and one upstairs. Something forbidding about
      the square old house, with its rows of unlighted windows, chilled his
      heart, struck deep into the energy that had carried him thus far, and he
      faltered. But this would not do. He forced his eyes down to the sidewalk
      and resolutely put his right foot on the next square of cement&mdash;then
      his left on the second square&mdash;and on, step by step, up the front
      walk. He mounted the steps and crossed the wide veranda to the door&mdash;then
      hurriedly pushed the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long wait. After a time he heard doors opening and closing
      within, and the sound of a person moving; finally there were footsteps in
      the hall and the door was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is&mdash;is Miss Davies here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;no. Miss Davies and her mother have gone East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone East!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; they are in the mountains&mdash;in Woodland Valley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Woodland Valley!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I couldn't tell you when they'll be back. They didn't know
      themselves when they left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment more and the door had closed and Halloran was down on the
      sidewalk. He turned aimlessly up the street. Gone East!&mdash;and no word
      for him! Perhaps his letters had not even reached her. Why had he not come
      straight back to Evanston that same week and claimed his answer? What an
      invertebrate creature he was, anyway! What a gloomy evening! How the
      shadows of the maples and elms closed down on his thoughts! The arc lamps
      at the corners, the long row of houses glowing with light, all smiled at
      him and drove him deeper into the gloom. Gone East!
    </p>
    <p>
      It occurred to him that he had come out for another purpose. There was
      nothing for it now but to go to the Bigelows'; and with a glance at his
      watch, he turned in that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The family were at dinner, he was informed, but Mrs. Bigelow would see him
      in a few moments. He was shown into a reception-room, where he could drop
      into a chair in the bay window and look in between the portières down the
      length of the living-room. The furniture was rich and heavy; the mantels
      and tables and bookcases were laden with bric-à-brac; the walls were
      covered with paintings and engravings, some of them fairly good, all of
      them very costly. From the dining-room came the jingle of knives and forks
      and the laughter of children, and now and then the heavy voice of Mr.
      Bigelow dominating. Then he heard the rustle of skirts and in came Mrs.
      Bigelow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, John? It is a long time since we have seen you. You must
      have gone away from Evanston when you left college.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I'm not living here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you now, John?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm up in Michigan.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a position there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I have heard Mr. Bigelow say that there are really about as good
      openings in the country as in the city. It is so overcrowded in Chicago.
      Are you getting on well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I guess so&mdash;as well as I could expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am very glad to hear that&mdash;and Mr. Bigelow will be, too. He really
      took quite an interest in you, John. He is always glad to know that the
      young men he has been interested in are getting on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have come down to Chicago to-day, Mrs. Bigelow, to look for a boy; and
      I have heard he is here. His name is George&mdash;George Bigelow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes; George. It is odd that he should have our name. He is a
      Settlement boy&mdash;Mr. Babcock rescued him from I don't know what
      distress. I wondered if there were any distant branch of the family that
      could have dropped in the world, but Mr. Bigelow says there is no
      connection whatever. It is a very common name in Chicago, he says. It
      seems that the boy's family is worthless, and he himself has already been
      in jail. But he seems to feel some remorse, and I am not letting it make
      any difference here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Craig, his grandfather, heard to-day from George's mother, after
      a long separation. We happen to be employed by the same company and I have
      come down with him to find his family. He wants to take them all back with
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To take him back? Why, he has been here only a little while. Did you mean
      to take him yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain Craig plans to give them all a supper this evening, and I
      promised him I would be on hand with George.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well; I will send for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stepped to the hall and rang a bell. While she was speaking to the
      maid Mr. Bigelow came into the hall, with a little girl hanging to each
      arm. He paused in the doorway of the reception-room and nodded to
      Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is John Halloran, dear,&rdquo; said his wife, turning. &ldquo;He has come to
      take George away. George's grandfather, he tells me, is really quite
      respectable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bigelow had shaken off the children and was getting into his overcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is just as well,&rdquo; he replied, without looking around. &ldquo;We really have
      no work for him here.&rdquo; At this moment the subject of the talk himself
      appeared, advancing bashfully, overcome by the splendour about him, and
      not yet knowing why he had been summoned. He looked at Halloran for a
      moment before he recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, George,&rdquo; said Halloran, advancing and holding out his hand.
      &ldquo;Do you remember me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George blushed, grinned and took his hand; and as he did so, Mr. Bigelow,
      with his coat buttoned and one glove on, turned around. He looked at
      George&mdash;a tall, awkward, ill-dressed boy of sixteen&mdash;with a
      curious, gruff expression, then his eyes shot one quick, inquiring look at
      Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll excuse me,&rdquo; he said, recovering. And without speaking further he
      went out and shut the door hard behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, George,&rdquo; said Halloran; &ldquo;I'm going to take you to a new home. Have
      you any truck to carry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your coat, then, and come along.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When they had reached the tenement and were nearly at the top of the
      stairway Halloran pushed George ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go in there, George. You'll find them together.&rdquo;.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hear 'em talking. But ain't you coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not yet. Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George opened the door and Halloran went back a little way down the stairs
      and sat down. It was dark and dirty. On all sides, above and below, were
      noises&mdash;babies squalling, men and women quarreling&mdash;but he heard
      little; his thoughts were speeding of! to the eastern mountains. There was
      a young woman in those mountains&mdash;where the leaves were beginning to
      turn, perhaps, as here in the West&mdash;only a thousand miles away. What
      had he been waiting for? Was it for her to write? How had he supposed her
      answer was to come? What stood in the way&mdash;circumstances? Some other
      one? Or was it that the only obstacle was a certain person sitting, at
      this moment, on a dark stairway in a tenement? More likely the latter&mdash;but
      how was he to discover it so close home? It was rather more fun to be
      miserable. Family reunion on one side of his thoughts, all hopes a
      thousand miles removed on the other side&mdash;on the whole, he preferred
      dark stairways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Halloran, are you there? It's so dark I can't see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; coming right up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was afraid you'd get away from us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I must be off now.&rdquo; They were entering the room. &ldquo;Le Duc wants
      you all over there to supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't go now, Mr. Halloran. He asked you, too, didn't he? Of course
      he did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'd like to, but&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, after the turn things have taken we couldn't have the
      supper without you. That's a part of it, you see&mdash;it's the way I
      planned it. You've got to come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you feel that way&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We do, and that's all there is about it. I guess we'd better be starting
      over, hadn't we? It's most half-past now. Where's your jacket, Jennie?&rdquo;
       Mrs. Craig had no jacket, it appeared; but the Captain helped her on with
      her shawl. &ldquo;Got your hat, George? Better let me have your arm, Jennie,
      going down the stairs. It's pretty dark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know these stairs, father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's so; I suppose you do. All ready, Mr. Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All ready, Captain. I'll put out the light. Go ahead.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down the stairs two and two, Mrs. Craig and the Captain,
      Halloran and George, and walked toward the lake, through the vicious quiet
      of the side streets, through the merriment of North Clark Street, through
      the sober, comfortable region of stone houses and big churches&mdash;on to
      the imposing private hotel where dwelt the Le Ducs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, father,&rdquo; whispered Mrs. Craig, &ldquo;that I'm not exactly dressed
      for this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense! My daughter needn't be ashamed to go anywhere. I wouldn't give
      <i>that</i> for a girl that wouldn't be glad to see her own mother, no
      matter if she came in a sunbonnet. There's nothing the matter with this
      shawl, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no; but it's old. And they're not wearing shawls now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care about that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care if you don't.&rdquo; And so determined was she not to care that
      she managed to force a little smile as her feet sank into the carpet and
      the door-boy stood aside to let her pass.
    </p>
    <p>
      Le Duc himself opened the door and greeted the group in the hall with a
      &ldquo;How are you? Come in!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They filed into the room, where a table was spread for them, and stood
      about awkwardly. Mrs. Craig busied herself with her bonnet and shawl,
      George stood on one leg and then on the other, and looked at the carpet;
      and Halloran slipped into the background. But the Captain broke the
      silence by advancing toward Le Duc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This must be Appleton, I take it. I'm glad to see you, young man&mdash;glad
      to welcome you into my family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Apples took the outstretched hand and murmured something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And where's Lizzie? I've got to see her before you can make me believe
      I've got a granddaughter old enough to be married. You'd never think it to
      look at Jennie, there, would you? Isn't she coming?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am,&rdquo; said the young woman herself, appearing in the doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked at her while the others stood silent; finally he walked
      around the table to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I can't believe it. I'm just going to kiss you, my dear. I guess
      your husband won't object if you kiss your own grandfather, will he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; certainly not,&rdquo; said Le Duc.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, so here we really are&mdash;all of us! Now we must have a
      good time of it. Where are we to sit, granddaughter? Don't forget to put
      me next to yourself. This almost makes me feel as if I was back in the old
      house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They took their places, and two waiters from the hotel restaurant appeared
      to serve them. And then Le Duc, with some sense of his responsibility as
      host, endeavoured to set the talk going, but without marked success. For
      both Mrs. Craig and her daughter felt awkward, and the Captain could not
      entirely master the oppressiveness of the surroundings and of the waiters
      in their dress suits. Halloran made one effort to enliven matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain, Apples&rdquo;&mdash;Le Duc's nose went up a little at the word&mdash;&ldquo;Apples
      was on the beach the night you came ashore in the surf-boat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so? Strange, isn't it, the way things come around, and the
      people you've met once are sure to turn up again? If I don't remember you,
      Appleton, it's because I wasn't feeling in shape to see anything that
      night but what was left of the old steamer. An ugly time that was. There
      was an hour or so before you lighted up your fire when I wouldn't have
      given half a dollar for our chances. The steamer was breaking up fast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see,&rdquo; said Apples, &ldquo;that must have been in my college days. Do you
      remember just when it was, Halloran?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not likely to forget it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was up the shore toward Glencoe, wasn't it? I remember one wreck up
      that way&mdash;you crew fellows had quite a time of it, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this feeble light on the conversation, darkness fell again; and the
      little family ate almost in silence, until the waiters brought in a
      platter of ducks and set them before Le Duc. The host looked suspiciously
      on them, then glanced at Lizzie. Finally, while his fingers toyed
      nervously with the carving knife and fork, his eyes sought the waiters;
      but one had left the room and the other was busy with the vegetables.
      Evidently he was expected to begin carving&mdash;the table waited,
      silently and expectantly&mdash;so he planted the fork in the right wing of
      the first duck and began. It did not go well. A brown fringe of gravy
      decorated the table-cloth around the platter, and little specks flew out
      occasionally toward the guests. Lizzie turned to Halloran and asked if he
      was living in the city now; and he replied that he was not. The brown
      fringe was widening; and George was watching the performance with
      increasing interest. Lizzie persisted: &ldquo;Are you going to be here long,
      this visit?&rdquo; No, he was going back to-morrow. The diversion failed here,
      and they waited in silence. Apples was breathing hard. At length, a quick,
      unskilful movement caused something to slip, and the end duck hopped
      neatly out on the table-cloth and settled down in a pool of gravy. Apples
      leaned back in his chair and looked at Lizzie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear&rdquo;&mdash;he began. But the waiter was at his elbow, saying,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I serve it, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this point the Captain rose, napkin in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you what, Appleton,&rdquo;, he said, &ldquo;you just change places with me.
      If there's one thing I know, it's ducks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After this, in spite of the gloom that settled on the host, the evening
      went better. And when the party broke up, at what the Captain called a
      scandalous hour, and scattered to hotel and tenement, there was some
      cordiality in the chorus of good-nights and good-byes. In the morning, by
      an early train, the three members of the Craig family and Halloran
      returned to Wauchung.

      CHAPTER XII&mdash;The Pine Comes In
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat settles it,&rdquo;
       exclaimed Halloran, tossing a letter on the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crosman looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've placed our last order for lumber this season,&rdquo; said Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have the Trust people waked up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Our Oconomowoc man writes that they refuse to sell him another foot
      unless they're assured that it won't come to us. They're pretty late about
      it. We've got nearly all we want. Well, that ends it, anyhow. The next
      thing is to get it all in. There's no use paying storage to all those
      fellows now that we're found out. I wish you'd see about getting both
      steamers off as soon as you can&mdash;send them to Chicago and Milwaukee,
      where we have the biggest lots. We'll write for steamers and schooners for
      the other towns.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can we get it all in the yards? There's a lot here now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got to. It will crowd up close to the mills, but we can't help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That will raise the insurance premium&mdash;clear up to the mill rate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want me to go ahead with the insurance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; not yet. Speak to me again about it in a day or so. This lumber isn't
      going to help us out very far if we let all our profits go out in storage
      and commissions and carriage and insurance. I don't know but what we'll
      have to carry it ourselves. It isn't just the weather I'd have picked out&mdash;but
      this business isn't of our choosing, anyway. I'd like to find out how much
      old G. Hyde knows about us. I don't believe he's got on the track of the
      whole stock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so the order went out to concentrate all the lumber at Wauchung; and
      at the flying word, passing from house to house, that at last there was to
      be work at the yards, Wauchung stirred and aroused. Again men came
      flocking to the office, shouldering peavies and cant-hooks and clamouring
      for employment. Sailors appeared to man the steamers and were set to
      scrubbing and polishing. Coal-wagons rumbled through the yards to the
      wharves, bringing food for the furnaces. Men went about grinning and
      joking and slapping backs heartily, and swapping yams about the Old
      Gentleman in his palmy days, ten and twenty years before. Robbie MacGregor
      appeared, fatter than ever after his enforced idleness, growling at all
      the known works of the Creator, and refusing to speak civilly to any one
      until he had let himself into his greasy blue overalls and was free to
      finger his levers, and dress down the oilers, and swear gloriously at the
      new hands in the stoke-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-afternoon, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; said Captain Craig, when he reached the
      office. &ldquo;When are we to start?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-night, if you have your men. MacGregor's on hand now, getting up
      steam.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good for Robbie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Captain, I'll try to have some work for George as soon as the
      first lot of lumber gets in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good. You'll find him ready for you. I'll be glad to get started
      again myself&mdash;it's been a mean pull; and there just wasn't any
      getting along with Robbie. I never saw him so down. Dry weather, isn't
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, better for you than for us. Are you going to let Bigelow steal your
      men off you this trip?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may have a chance yet&mdash;you're to go to Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain smiled dryly. He was in fine mettle now; his clear eyes and
      sound colour belied his wrinkles and the white streaks in his hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish he'd try it,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We'll be glad to hear from him any
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Late that afternoon the two steamers swung away from the wharves, one
      after the other, steamed out through the channel, passed the life-saving
      station and the lighthouse, and headed, the <i>Higginson Number 1</i>,
      sou'west-by-south toward Chicago, the Number 2 sou'west toward Milwaukee,
      to bring in the first loads of lumber. And a thrill went through the
      yards, where there were a few men at work, and passed on to the long lines
      of waiting labourers outside, as the shouts of the officers and the rumble
      of the engines and the wash of the propellers sounded through the dry
      autumn air. The mills were still silent the little world that depended
      almost for its existence on the movements of that machinery was still
      suffering from poverty and idleness, was still facing the possibility of a
      winter without employment; but somehow the sight of the two steamers once
      more plowing up the water of the harbour, of the blue smoke once more
      spreading low over the sand-dunes and over the sparkling lake that
      stretched beyond, spoke to them of new life at the Higginson yards. If the
      steamers were started out after the long wait, why might not the mills be
      soon humming and singing again, why might not the ax again flash and
      strike in the forest, and the songs of the river gang again ring down the
      long reaches of pine-edged water? The possibility was in the thoughts of
      them all as their eyes followed the steamers far out into the lake, and
      lingered on the fading smoke long after the boats themselves had dropped
      over the southwestern horizon. It was something to be moving again; and
      every one was a little more cheerful that evening for what they had seen
      and felt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now that the steamers were on the way, Halloran found that he had a
      problem on his hands. More than six million feet of lumber demands a large
      area, and the question of getting it into the yards was a serious one.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Higginson yards occupied a peninsula, formed on the inland side by the
      Wauchung River, on the other side by the harbour. This harbour was in
      reality a small lake, such as one will find duplicated every little way
      for a hundred and fifty miles on the eastern coast of Lake Michigan. The
      prevailing west winds have thrown up a line of high dunes along this
      shore, forming a natural dam at the mouth of each of the many small
      rivers. The Government had at Wauchung, as at many similar places, dredged
      out a channel that enabled steamers to get in to the wharves and to turn
      in the harbour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two mills were on the upper or river side of the peninsula, where they
      could receive the logs that were floated down from the timberlands.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the mills the cut timber was run out on elevated tramways and piled
      along the wharves. Ordinarily there was a wide space between the mills and
      the nearest pile of lumber. There was a provision, indeed, in the
      insurance policies, that it could not be piled nearer than two hundred
      feet without the payment of a higher premium; and if the piles should
      extend within fifty feet of the mills the rate mounted to an almost
      prohibitive point.
    </p>
    <p>
      The yards were surrounded by water on three sides&mdash;on the fourth were
      the cottages of the labourers and of the other poorer residents of the
      town. Halloran had a choice, then, between piling the lumber close around
      the mills (there being already a considerable quantity in the yards) and
      either paying the higher rate of insurance or going without, or carting it
      off and renting outside land for storage, thus adding a new item to his
      expenses. Every spare moment between this day and the arrival of the first
      steamer was spent in looking over the yards and planning the arrangement
      so as to get the best advantage of the space.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on the second day after the departure of the steamers that Crosman
      burst into the office and cried:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's coming in&mdash;the <i>Number Two!</i> I saw her funnels over the
      sand-hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His excitement was catching, and Halloran got up from his desk and looked
      out the window. Sure enough, there was the smoke, far out along the
      sky-line. A moment later, looking between the channel piers, he caught a
      glimpse of the steamer heading in toward the lighthouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watchful eyes had already seen her from the cottages near the beach; and
      as man after man hurried over to the yards to get an early place in the
      lines, the news spread through Wauchung. These men did not know what it
      meant&mdash;Bigelow was a myth to them, known, if at all, merely as an
      employer of labour twenty miles up the lake&mdash;but there was the
      steamer, bringing in a cargo of lumber that must be discharged and piled,
      and this meant work. Soon she was entering the channel; and they could see
      her Captain standing on the wheel-house roof with a hand resting on the
      bell-pull. And while Halloran went over to the wharf to direct the work,
      Crosman was kept busy giving out time-checks and cant-hooks and sending
      man after man across the yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she was in the harbour, was slipping up to the wharf; the engine-room
      bell jingled, and the propeller churned the water; the lines were thrown
      out and caught by eager hands, and the <i>Higginson No. 2</i> lay
      motionless at the wharf, her deck piled high with yellow hemlock and pine.
      The labourers swarmed over the rail and went at the work with the spirit
      of men who know what hunger means. The donkey-engines at each end of the
      deck rattled and clanked as the hoisting-spars were lowered over the
      cargo. And not a man on the ground, from Halloran down, but felt the
      impetus that the arrival of this first load of lumber had given to all
      Wauchung. Some of the men showed it by laughing easily, others by swearing
      easily, and now and then they would all break out into a song that would
      almost have shocked Jimmie McGinnis himself if he had been there to hear
      it&mdash;to the immortal air of
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      &ldquo;My father and mother were Irish,
    </p>
    <p class="indent15">
      And I was Irish, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not know that this song had been shouted by valiant fighters and
      workers in many tongues&mdash;sometimes to reputable words, oftener not&mdash;for
      centuries, nor did they care. It would not have interested them to hear
      that, thanks to its wonderful vitality, this same melody had served
      generations of students as &ldquo;We won't go home till morning&rdquo;; had swung
      thousands of wearied French soldiers along wild roads before Napoleon was
      born as &ldquo;<i>Malbrouck s'en va-t-en guerre</i>&rdquo;; had perhaps led white-clad
      swordsmen, with a lilt and rhythm that fairly lifted the feet, off to the
      taking of Jerusalem nearly a thousand years ago. And now here it was
      again, sung to disreputable words, but as truly as ever a shout of
      good-will and dauntless effort. Somebody had bucked the Old Gentleman&mdash;no
      matter who or how&mdash;and the Old Gentleman, through Mr. Halloran, was
      bucking back, was nearer than ever to winning. And when he should win, as
      win he must, there would be steady work and meat every day for the
      labourers of Wauchung. This was all they knew or cared. But was the spirit
      less honest and earnest than the spirit of those jack-booted Frenchmen or
      those white-clad crusaders? Allowing for the glamour of the past, for the
      shining mist that enlarges the old figures as their real outlines grow
      steadily fainter, were these hard-handed fellows, heaving the new lumber
      from the deck of the <i>Number Two</i> to the wharf, laughing and joking
      and swearing like pirates all the while, so different? Was there no
      romance here?
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the work had begun, Halloran saw Du Bois, an old lumber inspector,
      on the wharf and called to him. The old man, a soft felt hat pulled down
      on the side of his head, his gray beard streaked with tobacco, turned and
      waited for him to come up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a boy here, Du Bois&rdquo; [pronounced DoO Boyce], &ldquo;who thinks he'd like
      to learn lumber-checking. Suppose you take hold of him and see if we can
      make anything out of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Mr. Halloran. Where is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up at the office. You'd better send a man after him. His name's George
      Bigelow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir; I'll keep an eye on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector spat voluminously and hailed one of the labourers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi, you there! Run up to the office and tell George to get a scale and a
      tally-board and come down here. Grease your knees!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The labourer ambled off and soon returned with George.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, young man,&rdquo; said Du Bois, &ldquo;they tell me you're a lumber-checker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought maybe I could learn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that in your hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A tally-board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other hand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A scale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the size of that stick over there? No, don't scale it&mdash;stand
      here. What are your eyes for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      George had not passed the last few days idly. The lumbermen were a
      picturesque, vigorous lot of men, and simply by associating with them he
      had begun absorbing some knowledge of their work. Now he made a snap
      guess. &ldquo;Two-by-twelve-sixteen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Other one yonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two-by-eight-twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call that a twelve? You'll have to do better than that. See that steamer?
      We're going to unload her in another minute, and I want you to mark down
      every stick on your tally-sheet as the boys take it off. Tend your
      business, now. We'll put some hair on your chest before we get through
      with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So George took his place on the wharf as the <i>Number Two</i> came
      alongside, and promptly found himself the centre of a dozen gangs of men
      all hustling past with the sticks, while the two steamer-hoists lowered
      them over in bundles, and the men on the steamer slid them off from half a
      dozen points at once. Each plank and timber, Du Bois had said, was to be
      checked on the tally-sheet and its dimensions recorded.

    <p>
      Halloran, Crosman and Du Bois met for a moment near the office where they
      could overlook the yards. The Inspector was shaking his head at the still,
      blue sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to see a few clouds up there, Mr. Halloran. We ain't had any
      rain since the devil knows when.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran, for reply, stirred up the sawdust with his foot. It was dry and
      loose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like it, myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we going to pile it in all through here? You ain't figuring on taking
      any outside, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we can't do that. Fill in the strip yonder&rdquo;&mdash;indicating the
      narrow end of the peninsula&mdash;&ldquo;before you take up the ground around
      the mills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about the insurance?&rdquo; suggested Cros-man. &ldquo;I haven't done anything
      about it yet. Shall I see to it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; we'll carry it ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman and the Inspector were silent for a time after this, and all three
      looked down at the activity on the wharf. Neither of the assistants knew
      what a relief it was to the Manager to see that one load of lumber and to
      know that there was a score of other loads already on the way. It was his
      first glimpse of the tangible cause of the fighting, and the sight of it
      gave him the feeling of actually getting his hands on something. There was
      still to be considered the guarding it from fire, and, at the right
      moment, the putting it on the market. He did not know what new move
      Bigelow might be considering, but he could not see how any living man
      could block him now. Every order had been delivered to a lake port, so
      that he had no need to call on the railroads. And an attempt to restrain
      him from using the lake carriers, in view of the fact that the Higginson
      steamers alone could do the work with an extra allowance of time, seemed
      out of the question. Bigelow would resort to rascality, of course,
      whenever he could see or make an opening; but it was a question whether he
      could find any more openings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wasn't here when we had the big fire, in '79?&rdquo; The Inspector was
      falling into a reminiscent frame of mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hardly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was before we had a steam fire-engine. There was only a hand-machine
      downtown&mdash;damn little syringe on wheels&mdash;wouldn't put out a box
      of matches if the wind was blowin'&mdash;and so the Old Gentleman kep'
      about a hundred buckets hung in the mills. Joe Brady was fire chief&mdash;he
      worked in the freight house. But the fire come on a Sunday and Joe 'd been
      loadin' up ever since six o'clock Saturday night, and when him and the
      boys come up with their squirt-gun they'd forgot the key to the fire-plug,
      and they hadn't brung hose enough to use the river. Buck Patterson&mdash;he
      was superintendent&mdash;was passin' out buckets, and he come out to see
      what was the matter, and you'd ought to a-heard him talk to Joe. Buck was
      pretty profane, sometimes, and he just busted out that night. I guess he'd
      never had much use for Joe, only he hadn't had a chance to tell him about
      it before. 'Why, you dam gutter-sponge of a patty de foy graw,' says he&mdash;I'm
      only tellin' you what he said; I was standin' right by and heard the whole
      thing&mdash;he called him a patty de foy graw!&mdash;'You wart,' he says,
      'you liver-eyed, kettle-bellied soak, you ain't fit to polish
      toastin'-forks in hell!' He never talked just like nobody else, Buck
      didn't. All this while Joe was hollerin' to little Murphy to run for the
      key and Murphy was hollerin' back, 'You go to the devil, your father, and
      get it yourself,' and sayin' it over and over, he was so excited; when
      Buck just took Joe by the collar and give him a jolt with his knee, and
      told him to shut up and get that key, and Joe tun off meek as an infant in
      arms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the loss that night?&rdquo; asked Crosman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About twenty thousand&mdash;eighty per cent, insured. The Old Gentleman
      didn't have a very comf'terble time himself. He'd been ridin' around on
      his buckboard tellin' the boys what to do. He started downtown after more
      buckets, and just as he got out to the bridge I looked up and see him all
      a-blazin' out behind. He didn't even know it yet. Must ha' been a spark
      lit on his coat-tails. I hollered at him, but he was whippin' up the mare,
      and I had to chase him across the bridge. He begun to feel funny then, and
      when he pulled up I grabbed his arm and jerked the reins out of his hand,
      and hauled him off the seat and rolled down the bank with him into the
      river. I guess there ain't much doubt I saved his life&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Hello, they're stopping work down there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last exclamation was caused by the Manager starting abruptly for the
      wharf. Crosman and the Inspector followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work was not wholly stopped, but a little group of labourers was
      gathered about a stick of timber watching George, who was measuring it
      with his scale. Some of the other workmen were standing and sitting
      nearby, laughing and bantering, while a few made a small pretense of work.
      When Halloran came on the scene George looked up with a dogged expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this?&rdquo; Halloran asked the gang-boss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We was going a little too fast for the kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Evidently George had interpreted his orders strictly, and when his eye
      failed him in the bewilderment of seeing a dozen sticks passing at a time,
      had stopped each one to scale it. Halloran turned to Du Bois.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give the boy a lift, will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0010" id="linkimage-0010"> </a>

      <a href="images/0205.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The old Inspector nodded, with a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, young man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;take 'em down for me. Go ahead, boys!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He hitched himself up on the cap of a snubbing-post, and when the
      donkey-engines clanked again and the timbers came dropping and sliding to
      the wharf, and the files of labourers shuffled past, he went on with his
      story. His eyes roved absently up and down the wharf, and a half-circle of
      tobacco juice rapidly formed around the post. Not a stick escaped his eye,
      within a hundred feet of rapidly moving timbers; George's pencil was kept
      flying over the tally-sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;we went down that bank&mdash;two-b'-four-fourteen,
      two-b'-eight-ten&mdash;like two cats&mdash;two-b'-ten-sixteen&mdash;a-fightin'.
      Two-b'-twelve-twelve. The Old Gentleman didn't&mdash;two-b'-twelve-eighteen&mdash;
      know yet just what was up&mdash;two-b'-six-twelve, two-b'-six-fourteen&mdash;and
      he got his hand twisted up in my hair&mdash;two-b'-ten-ten, two-b'-ten-
      fourteen, two-b'-ten-twelve&mdash;and when we struck the water&mdash;two-b'-
      twelve-ten, two-b'-eight-eighteen&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A few minutes later, when Halloran passed again that way, Du Bois was
      still in the story, though he had now no auditor but the preoccupied
      George.
    </p>
    <p>
      That same night another steamer came in, and within a few days it was
      necessary to put on a night shift to keep up with the influx of lumber.
      The yards filled rapidly with high piles until the tramways and mills were
      nearly hidden from sight. New lumber it was, not yet so dry but that some
      of the water from the rivers still moistened it; and the air was sweet
      with the scent of pine. It brought to mind the deep forests far back from
      the lake, the rustle of the wind through the new boughs far overhead, and
      the long, still aisles, carpeted in fragrant brown, where the deer run.
      There were bears out there, skulking away from the axman, grubbing up wild
      turnips and hunting ants and slugs in rotten stumps; there were otter and
      muskrats and perhaps a lingering colony of beaver. Soon the time would
      come when the deer and bear could reclaim their lands, for the axmen were
      nearly through. Another score of years, perhaps, and where had been great
      forests would be a waste of blackened stumps&mdash;all &ldquo;cut out&rdquo; for the
      market. Rivers would be lower and dams useless. Thriving lumber cities on
      the lake would be facing ruin&mdash;their reason for being gone with the
      last timber&mdash;or casting about to attract manufacturers or to
      cultivate beets&mdash;anything to stop the drain on their vitality as the
      restless lumbermen should turn west or south for new lands where they
      could found new cities and begin the problem anew.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten days it was all in, the six million and odd feet of boards and
      timber. And as Halloran walked down to the bridge one night and leaned on
      the railing and looked over the broad piles he was nervous and depressed.
      A part of the strain was over and he was feeling the reaction. The key to
      the situation was in his hands now&mdash;it rested with him to carry the
      lumber safely over to the day for selling, and then to make it pay. He
      could not yet see Mr. Higginson. He had been to Doctor Brown's this
      evening and the Doctor was decisive. The moon came out as he stood there
      and shed its light on the river and the lumber. He straightened up to go;
      then waited until he caught a glimpse of the watchman on his round of the
      yards.

      CHAPTER I&mdash;A Little Talk with Captain Craig
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ull as the
      newspapers were of the great corn deal on the Board of Trade, there was no
      getting at the facts that lay behind it. The brokers seemed to look on Le
      Duc as their principal; Le Duc had nothing to say. Halloran read the
      papers eagerly every day, watching for a word that would justify his
      conjectures, but the secret was too well kept.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning a day or two after the lumber had come in, he asked Craig to
      step into the office.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I want to talk to you about this corn business. I'm
      inclined to think that if we could find out who is backing Apples it might
      be just what we want to know most.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think it's Bigelow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if it is Bigelow, and if his reasons for keeping dark are what I
      think, the sooner we know it the better for Higginson &amp; Company. Do
      you think, from anything Mrs. Craig has said, that Bigelow knows who
      Apples and his wife are?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, no. Jennie doesn't talk much about those times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to bother you with this, Captain, but business and family
      matters are so mixed that I don't know any other way to get at it. Would
      you be willing to find out if there were any letters&mdash;anything that
      Le Duc might have got hold of that would give him a grip on Bigelow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain looked grave. &ldquo;I kind o' don't like to stir her up, now she's
      having such a good rest. But&mdash;well, I don't know why not. Yes, I'll
      ask her. I'm afraid,&rdquo; he added, as he arose, &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm getting kind
      o' chicken-hearted these days. You see, I haven't had her back very long.
      Yes, the first good chance that comes along I'll talk it over with her and
      let you know what she says.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      During most of the day Halloran was shut up in the office, figuring and
      working out some new schedules. At noon he spent an hour or more uptown,
      and a half-hour climbing around under the bridge; and later Crosman was
      hailed, out in the yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could you drop around this evening for awhile?&rdquo; said Halloran.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes,&rdquo; was the rather reluctant reply, followed by a blush and a
      grin. &ldquo;Any particular time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right after supper, for half an hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I'll be there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the evening, when Crosman entered the Manager's room, the first thing
      he observed was a purple sweater on the back of a chair by the bed. Below
      it was an old pair of trousers, a cap, and, on the floor, a pair of rubber
      boots. He glanced curiously at these things as he greeted his superior;
      and Halloran's eyes followed his.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my fireman's rig,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Didn't know I was on the department,
      did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. What's all this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what I want to see you about, as much as anything. I haven't gone to
      sleep a night since the lumber began coming in without expecting to hear
      the bell before morning. If the stuff was mine maybe I wouldn't care so
      much.&rdquo; Crosman's face sobered. &ldquo;But you said we'd carry the insurance
      ourselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't suppose I wanted to do it that way, did you? We can't pay the
      price, that's all. And we can't lose the lumber, either. It's up to us to
      see that nothing happens. I've worked out a little plan here and I want
      you to help me carry it through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman drew up his chair to the table. His mind had been fully occupied
      of late, and it had not before come home to him what a heavy&mdash;what a
      very heavy&mdash;load his Manager was carrying. Now these six million feet
      of pine and hemlock loomed in his thoughts and brought a very serious
      expression to his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cheer up, old man; we haven't lost it yet, that I know of, and we're
      going to do our best not to lose it. But you see, in buying this lumber
      and getting it all in here, we've done only half of it; the other half is
      to take care of it and sell it at a profit. Now look at this. I've
      borrowed some spare hose from the department. That's coming over in the
      morning, and we'll have it coupled onto the plug by Mill No. 1 and kept
      ready under the tramway. Our own hose will be coupled to the west plug.
      The two steamers are to be at the wharf, with steam up, all the time,
      ready to throw a stream on anything near the wharves: they'll lie one at
      each end, you see. The engineers are to stand watches aboard and keep a
      couple of hands sleeping by to man the hose. Then, if we have two watchmen
      always on duty, and the rest of the boys sleeping in their shirts and
      stockings, we could do fairly quick work, with the town engine to help.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are the buckets in the mills, and by the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; we'll use those, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this&rdquo;&mdash;he was examining the paper&mdash;&ldquo;is the way you want the
      boys divided?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. If the fire should be at the north end, where the yards are widest,
      you will take charge of the hose at the mill plug and see that the buckets
      are started; I'll take the west plug, where I can have an eye on the
      wharves. Those are the men to work with you, these with me. You'd better
      see yours the first thing in the morning&mdash;here's the schedule of
      watches&mdash;and engage them. You see, they're all men that live near the
      fence. Tell them we don't want a man that can't get to his station two
      minutes after the <i>Number One</i> blows her whistle, no matter if it's
      2:30 A. M.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The whistle will be the signal, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I've told MacGregor to blow until he hears the bark of every dog in
      town. I want to get this all fixed in the morning, and so fixed that there
      can't be any misunderstandings. Any time after to-morrow noon, if that
      whistle blows, it means get to the yards in two minutes or lose your job.
      You'd better tell them that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I'll see to it. But gee whiz!&rdquo; Crosman leaned back and looked
      at Halloran. &ldquo;Here we're talking about this just as if it was going to
      happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe it is. Anyhow, that's how we've got to look at it. I'd talk
      to the boys that way, too.&rdquo; He rose and sat on the corner of the table,
      looking down earnestly at the other. &ldquo;They've got to understand that we
      mean business. And say, look here, Crosman; what are we sitting here
      talking about this for? Why aren't we doing it to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman's expression dropped from serious to dismal. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;all
      right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry if I'm butting into any plans of yours, but good Lord, old man,
      have you stopped to think what this means? Here I'd got my mind settled on
      to-morrow when I ought to have known all the while that to-day was the
      time. We'll do it now. You look up the boys on that paper and I'll root
      mine out and have them bring the hose over. We'll get everything in shape
      before we go to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The assistant was caught up and whirled along by Halloran's energy. &ldquo;All
      right,&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;But I ought to call Mamie up. She's&mdash;she's&mdash;I
      was thinking of going around there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Use my telephone. Excuse me if I start right out, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before Crosman could stammer a &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; he had snatched up his hat and
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disagreeable as rush orders might be to a man with his family about him of
      an evening, there was nothing to be said; and within an hour some were
      starting out for duty on watch, or for a night on one of the steamers,
      while others dragged the hose-reel out of the town and across the bridge
      to the yards and put it in order for instant use. When the preparations
      were completed, toward eleven o'clock, Halloran called the men together
      and gave them their final instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crosman and he were left alone for a moment when the last man had gone to
      his post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;that's a good job done,&rdquo; observed the assistant. &ldquo;I guess
      there's nothing more, is there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;&mdash;- Oh, yes; one thing. I've thought a good deal about the
      south end. The yard's narrow there for quite a way and there's no fireplug
      at that end.&rdquo; They were walking through the gate and toward the bridge.
      &ldquo;It's the least likely place to catch first, because there's water on
      three sides, but if it should there's only one thing we could do. Look
      here! Under the town end of the bridge&mdash;I'll show you when we get
      there&mdash;I've hung a tin pail with matches and fuses in it, where it
      won't be disturbed and it's likely to keep dry. And about fifty yards down
      the bank there's some dynamite in another pail under the water. I've put a
      sign on a post to scare the boys away. There, see that white thing? That's
      it! I couldn't keep the stuff home or in the yards, and there, I think, is
      about the safest place. You see, if either of us should be running out
      here we could just turn off the road a little way and pick up the two
      pails. It's on Higginson land and I don't believe any one can object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went down together to see that the pails had not been molested. &ldquo;I've
      given orders,&rdquo; said Halloran, &ldquo;to several of the boys to come down here
      every time they pass and report if anything's wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Crosman was aroused by the work of the evening. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he burst out, as
      they were climbing the fence and taking the road again, &ldquo;I must say you've
      just about covered the ground. I don't know of anything more we could do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;I feel a little better, anyway. I'll walk along to the
      house with you, if you're going that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;I&mdash;I'm not, exactly. I kind of said&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to stop around at the Higginsons', eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I might, if&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; good-night. Look out that they don't shoot you for a burglar.
      But, say; hold on a minute. Has the crisis come yet with&mdash;with Mr.
      Higginson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; they expect it to-morrow. Doctor McArthur came up from Chicago this
      afternoon, and the other one, the Detroit doctor, gets in late to-night.
      Mamie's waiting up for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The following afternoon, as Halloran was closing his desk, Captain Craig
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had a little talk with Jennie this noon, Mr. Halloran. I had to
      explain to her about things, and how you felt a little delicate about it,
      and she told me the whole thing. You see, it's considerable of a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran closed the door and drew up a chair. &ldquo;Sit down, Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, it all goes back to a few months after Lizzie was married. Le
      Duc wasn't doing very well and he made it pretty uncomfortable for Jennie,
      talking about supporting her and that sort of thing; and finally one day
      he asked her if she didn't have letters or anything that could make it
      worth while to see Bigelow. Jennie'd never have done anything in the
      world, no matter though the alimony <i>had</i> been allowed her by the
      courts; she always had a horror of going to law about it. But Le Duc was
      hard pushed, and I guess she was glad to do anything that would make
      things easier for all of them, so she let him have Bigelow's letters&mdash;most
      of them promising to send money. They were all, she says, plain evidence
      that he hadn't paid her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran was sitting far back in his chair, his hands clasped around one
      knee, his eyes fixed on the desk. And while the Captain talked, his
      thoughts were running swiftly backward and forward and all around this
      interesting subject. He was hearing what he had most wished to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so Le Duc went out to Evanston one night to see him, and they were
      all excited about it, Jennie says. But after that things took a change. Le
      Duc wouldn't say much about it&mdash;-he acted a little queer&mdash;but he
      sort of made her think nothing was coming of it. And then, a little later,
      he got a job, nobody seemed to know just what&mdash;and moved over to
      where they are now. And he let Jennie and the McGinnis boy understand that
      they could come with them if they would pay a rather high board. Oh, he's
      a&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; Craig thought it better to pause, and turned his
      thoughts away from the meanness of his son-in-law. He went on with better
      control. &ldquo;Of course Jennie couldn't do that, so they went without her. And
      Jennie was so timid about it all she didn't even like to ask for her
      letters back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Apples has them still?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; he's got them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And is that all she knows?&rdquo; Halloran could not keep a little
      disappointment out of his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the whole thing. He's been keeping his mouth shut up tight
      about the whole business. It pretty nearly tells the story, don't you
      think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, in a way. It's not quite enough to move on, I'm afraid. But
      I'll have to think it over; and maybe I can see a way through. We don't
      know yet that G. Hyde is behind that corner&mdash;but I'm much obliged,
      Captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're welcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Captain hurried home to have a few hours with his family, for now that
      Halloran's &ldquo;fire department&rdquo; was organized he was sleeping, by choice, on
      his steamer.
    </p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      It was two o'clock the next morning. Crosman was far, far away, coasting
      down the joyous hills of dreamland. A laughing girl was at his side. She
      could not play long with him, for dimly he understood that the doctors
      were coming, and she must be at her post to welcome them. It would never
      do for the doctors to come and find no greeting from Mamie. But dreamland
      was bright to-night&mdash;the Little Folk were out in force, dancing like
      thistle-down over the Queen Anne's lace, or coasting with him down the
      starry slopes, a half-dozen on his back, more at his ears whistling gaily
      that Mamie was true&mdash;Blue for true!&mdash;Blue for true!&mdash;and
      hundreds of the maddest fellows capering on ahead, bounding and blowing
      from blossom to blossom. One danced far before, clad in a purple sweater
      and hearing a whistle. Now and again he blew a blast, daintily at first,
      like the signal of mint to the bees, then louder and shriller and
      shriller. It screeched hoarsely in his ears; a cold wind nipped at his
      legs and feet; the Little Folk were swarming around him, all in purple
      now, shouting wildly, urging him on&mdash;on&mdash;hurry&mdash;hurry! The
      whistle was deeper and hoarser&mdash;where was he&mdash;where&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;-?
    </p>
    <p>
      He was on his feet in the centre of the floor. Through the open window
      came the deep whistle of the <i>Number One</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      In ten seconds he had tumbled into his trousers. Five more, and his boots
      were on. Another ten, and he was banging down the stairs and out the door,
      leaving it open behind him&mdash;and struggling into his coat as he ran.
      He could not guess how long the whistle had been sounding; but there was
      as yet no light in the sky above the yards. He must be on time: it lay
      with him to set an example to the men. His side was aching already, but he
      ran it down. As he drew near to the bridge he came out in full view of the
      yards, but could see no light. Perhaps he was early&mdash;perhaps the fire
      was starting on the river side. He thought of the dynamite, and with a
      bound was over the fence and running down to the water. A moment more and
      he was making for the bridge, pail in hand. As he paused here he heard
      some one running across, above him; and farther off were shouts and the
      sounds of running. The <i>Number One</i> was still whistling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the bridge he went, a tin pail in each hand; around the corner of the
      fence and on to the open gate. He was dashing through when he was hailed
      by a familiar voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There, sitting on a projecting plank of the nearest lumber-pile, was
      Halloran, a lantern in one hand, his watch in the other. Grouped around
      him were half a dozen panting men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Crosman. False alarm. But you've made bully time&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;
      Look out, there!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This last was addressed to Du Bois, who came whirling around the gate-post
      and crashed full-tilt into Crosman. The assistant staggered, but recovered
      his balance; and the two sat down with the others. The men came bounding
      in until fully thirty were there&mdash;more by five or six than had been
      engaged. Halloran threw the light of his lantern on them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Time's up,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Where's Potin?&rdquo; [pronounced Pot'n.]
    </p>
    <p>
      No one answered, but after a moment the missing Canadian appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're late,&rdquo; said Halloran. &ldquo;What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The man had to pause to breathe. &ldquo;It took me a m-min-ute, Mister Halloran.
      I&mdash;I guess I didn't hear the first whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We need better ears than yours, then. We can't use you after this.
      Runyon&rdquo;&mdash;turning to one of the promptest of the outsiders&mdash;&ldquo;I'll
      take you on in Potin's place. We don't pay men to sleep. That's all now,
      boys. You can go home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But now that they were aroused there was a tendency to wait and talk it
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you got in them pails, Mr. Crosman?&rdquo; called Du Bois. &ldquo;Did you forget
      and bring your lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; it's dynamite.&rdquo; In a conversational tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what? Say, you're fooling!&rdquo; He drew back as he spoke. The other men
      looked at one another.
    </p>
    <p>
      For reply Crosman produced a brown cylinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord! And I run into that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In another moment Halloran and Crosman were alone. Down the alleys,
      between the piles, around the mill, out the gate&mdash;for every hole a
      man could squeeze through was abruptly pressed into service&mdash;the men
      had disappeared. And when the noise of the scampering feet had died away,
      Halloran said, with a chuckle: &ldquo;Here's Du Bois's hat. I'll take it along.&rdquo;
       The next morning he found him on the wharf. &ldquo;You didn't stop for your hat
      last night, Du Bois. I guess you were called away suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The Inspector accepted the hat and pulled it on, drew out his
      tobacco-pouch, bit a half-moon from his plug, tucked it away in his cheek,
      and swept his eyes quizzically around the harbour. &ldquo;That's all right, Mr.
      Halloran; that's all right,&rdquo; he observed, discharging a preliminary brown
      streak. &ldquo;I s'pose I've got to go up against old Salt Peter some day or
      other, but if I'm goin' to have anything to say about it myself I'd a heap
      rather go up whole. If I was to come an arm or a leg at a time he might
      think it was old G. Hyde Bigelow tryin' to fool him in sections, and the
      first thing I knew he'd be sayin', 'Bigelow, you darned old pile o' culls,
      there's a line o' little red divils down there a-sittin' up nights for
      you. Git along!'&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II&mdash;Going to Headquarters
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>alloran had not
      yet exhausted his resources in getting at the facts behind the corn deal.
      There was one person who probably could, if he would, carry the story
      further, and that was Jimmie McGinnis. And so Halloran decided to run down
      to Chicago.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain, when he heard of it, came to see him. &ldquo;Harry Crosman says
      you're going down to the city, Mr. Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; I shall take the night train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I told Jennie about it she wondered if you'd be going anywhere near
      Lizzie's place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can, easily enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jennie, you see, has been sort of looking for some word from her this
      week, and there ain't none come yet, and would you mind taking along a
      little bundle for Lizzie, and maybe a note?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit. You'll have them here before supper time, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; surely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And so it fell out that Halloran boarded the train that night with the
      bundle under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      His trip was to be as short as he could make it, for he did not like to be
      away at this time. Full instructions were left with his assistant; and his
      post as amateur fire marshal was assigned to the Captain during his
      absence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, it seemed, had been with the Le Ducs until the change. Where to
      find him now was a question, or it would have been if his eye had not
      alighted on the name &ldquo;Elmer Le Duc&rdquo; in the evening paper, among the
      attractions advertised by a Clark Street vaudeville theatre. He reached
      Chicago in the morning, and in the afternoon dropped around to the
      theatre. From the display of the name in five-inch letters on the
      bill-boards of a downtown continuous performance it was to be inferred
      that Jimmie was getting on in the world. His position on the programme,
      too&mdash;toward three o'clock&mdash;and the little burst of applause that
      followed the appearance of his name on the announcement card at the side
      of the stage, aided the impression. And finally, when the familiar
      wizen-faced, thin-legged boy, as undersized as ever, appeared, shouted out
      the preliminary song of his specialty, and fell into a long and
      wonderfully intricate dance, there was no doubting he had popped into
      favour. When he had disappeared, after the third recall, and the next turn
      was announced, Halloran slipped out and strolled a few steps up the alley
      that led to the stage-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      A quarter of an hour later a large, coarse-featured young woman, wearing a
      rakish French costume, came out into the alley; and behind her, barely
      reaching to her shoulder, in the unfamiliar get-up of a light suit, a
      wide-brimmed pearl-gray hat, tan shoes, and a bamboo stick, appeared
      Jimmie. They started to walk off together, but at Halloran's hail the
      young man turned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you,&rdquo; he said with a nod, somewhat as if their last meeting had
      been but a few hours earlier. &ldquo;Want to speak to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At Halloran's affirmative, he left the woman, who stared at Halloran as
      she waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Been to the show?&rdquo; asked Jimmie. &ldquo;Got 'em cold, ain't I? I always told Le
      Duc I could do it the minute I got a chance at a big house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been looking for you, Jimmie. Won't you have dinner with me to-night
      at the Auditorium?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dinner, eh? What time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Half-past six.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so. You see I was goin' with Jane&mdash;that's Jane Scott, you
      know; greatest character singer and dancer on the stage. We're goin' to be
      married next week, and I'm sorter supposed to hang around her most of the
      time. But I guess I can make it. Anythin' doin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing very much. I'll look for you, then, at half-past six, in the main
      office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The dinner hour had come before Halloran could stop wondering over the
      idea of Jimmie McGinnis marrying. When they were seated together at a
      quiet table he spoke of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're going to be married, Jimmie?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; sure. But say, they ain't callin' me that no more. I'm Elmer Le Duc
      now, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you starting in rather young?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, not for a man in the profession. You see, Jane's husband&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her husband!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. He's a skate, you see&mdash;lushes. He's a fool, too, 'cause Jane's
      kind-hearted, and she'd a-gone right on supportin' him if he'd a-treated
      her half decent. She can haul in her hundred and twenty-five every week in
      the year&mdash;regular gold-mine. And a man that ain't got head enough to
      hold on to a thing like that 'ad better drop off. We've been talkin' it
      over, Jane an' me, ever since I made my hit. You see, she's got a two-part
      skit that calls for a small man, smaller'n her, a part I can walk right
      into; an' I thought it over an' told her I'd marry her an' manage the
      business. She's told me since, she knew the minute she struck me that I
      was her man. It's a good thing for both of us, you see. We can clear up
      two hundred a week easy, and our expenses won't be near so much. I told
      her I'd put up the cash for her divorce. It's such a sure case that it
      ain't costin' a great lot. Of course, I don't need to marry her, but the
      savin' in doublin' up on hotel an' sleeper bills 'll more'n pay for the
      divorce the first year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran looked at Jimmie, shook his head, and then smiled in spite of
      himself. And Jimmie had to grin a little, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a question how to open the next subject. Halloran knew that,
      wherever there was a choice of ways to an end, one open and direct, the
      other tortuous and subterranean, Jimmie's mind would instinctively seek
      the latter. He thought he had better slip easily from the one subject to
      the other; for if the boy were to suspect him of any strong desire to
      inform himself concerning Le Duc he would most likely draw back, from
      sheer perversity, into his shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you're known as Le Duc now? Didn't you travel with them for
      awhile?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but it wouldn't go. Too much madam there. Let me tell you this, Mr.
      Halloran. Don't you ever go into partnership with a man and his wife. It's
      hell on wheels.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They didn't get on well, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; the only payin' thing in the combination was the name. Le Duc's one
      of the best names in the profession, an' he's been more'n square about
      lettin' me go on an' use it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw them a little while ago at their hotel. He seems to have struck a
      good thing now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they say he's a big man on the Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did he ever get into it? There must be somebody behind him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie fingered his fork and looked up with an expressionless face. &ldquo;Is
      they?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran tried again. &ldquo;I don't know, but I'm inclined to think there's
      more in it than the papers say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jimmie, for some reason, chose to give no information whatever on this
      question. And Halloran had the questionable pleasure of bidding him
      good-evening in the consciousness that he was no nearer what he wanted to
      know than he had been in Wauchung. The next step was a matter of careful
      thinking; he was not even sure that there could be a next step. Meantime,
      he had an errand at the Le Ducs', and as it was not yet eight o'clock he
      decided to run up there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The great event had taken place in the Le Duc household. And when Halloran
      was shown into the apartment, he found a happy father in his shirt-sleeves
      dancing about a small white bundle on the sofa, a beaming mother also in
      dishabille, and a simpering nurse-maid. Apples was cordial, merry,
      expansive; he was delighted to see his old friend Halloran&mdash;fairly
      dragged him in. Good stories and playful allusions were continually rising
      in his mind and finding expression. He was boisterously demonstrative, and
      given to squeezing his wife's hand or slipping his arm around her as his
      tongue rattled along.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran delivered his message and his bundle, and finally, when he had
      been made to say all that there is to be said about some other man's
      infant, the mother and nurse took it away and left the two men to smoke
      and chat.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time there came a pause. And then an idea that had been floating
      in Halloran's mind since his disappointment with Jimmie took sudden form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like working with Bigelow?&rdquo; he asked, without the slightest
      change of expression, knocking the ash off his cigar as he spoke. And
      Apples took the bait.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;First rate. He's a driver, but he's got a great head on him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know. I used to work for him myself, out in Evanston. I don't
      believe he has ever done much on the Board before this deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't think he has.&rdquo; A peculiar expression was coming into Le Due's
      face. &ldquo;Who told you about it?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I've always known more or less of his movements. He was hit rather
      hard in Kentucky Coal a little while back, but I suppose this corner will
      more than square that, if it goes through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Le Duc smiled. &ldquo;Don't you worry about that. I guess that coal business is
      nothing he can't stand. A momentary change of opinion doesn't alter the
      fact that there's just as much coal there as there ever was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose there is&mdash;just as much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Le Duc was looking not quite comfortable. &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;there
      are times with every man whose interests are spread out widely&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
       But this wouldn't do. He was blundering deeper and deeper into some sort
      of a trap, and not wholly grasping the situation, he decided to keep
      still.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had learned enough. His trip to Chicago was not to be a failure,
      after all. He had learned so much, in fact, that when he was back in his
      room at the hotel and could sit down and think it all over, there seemed
      to be no reason for delay in turning his information to account. Over and
      over again that night he considered his case: he tested it from every
      point of view to assure himself of its soundness; and in the morning,
      instead of heading for Wauchung, he wired Crosman that he would return by
      way of the lumbering town of Corrigan, the seat of the Corrigan mills, in
      the upper peninsula. The Corrigans were among the largest owners in the
      &ldquo;combine&rdquo;; and if they were as tired of losing money as he believed, they
      would doubtless be glad to hear what he had to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an eight-hour ride from Chicago to Corrigan, and evening was so
      near when he arrived that he went directly to his hotel for some dinner,
      and made arrangements by telephone to see the younger Mr. Corrigan at his
      home in the evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that we have ever met, Mr. Corrigan,&rdquo; Halloran said, when
      the two men were closeted. &ldquo;I am with Higginson &amp; Company, of
      Wauchung. Your company and ours have not agreed, so far, in our attitude
      toward G. Hyde Bigelow. Mr. Higginson refused his offers at the start
      because we had reason to distrust him. We know now that we were right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corrigan looked at him with some surprise. &ldquo;If you have any charges to
      make against Mr. Bigelow you should see him, not me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no charges, Mr. Corrigan, but I rather think you have. I've come
      here to lay them before you and leave you free to push them or not, as you
      choose. As I understand it, when this combination was organized, Mr.
      Bigelow was generally thought to be a responsible man. We didn't believe
      it, so we stood out rather than have him direct our business. Since that
      time he has got into such difficulties with his Kentucky investments that
      in order to raise money he has taken to speculating heavily on the Board
      of Trade. He is operating the big corn deal through the man named Le Duc.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll excuse me, sir, but I don't see&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused, and Halloran went on: &ldquo;You understand, Mr. Corrigan, that our
      position is what it was at the start&mdash;we are against this
      combination. And if I didn't believe that you are going to be against it,
      too, I shouldn't be here. I think you'll agree with me that if what I say
      is tme, Mr. Bigelow is not a man to trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If it is tme&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And there is a way to prove it. I suggest that at the meeting, which
      comes, I believe, next month, you lay these charges before Mr. Bigelow,
      without warning, and give him a chance to explain. You are at liberty to
      say that I gave you the information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was all he had come to say, and he was so sure of its effect that he
      was willing to leave it and give the seed time to grow. But Corrigan was
      aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This&mdash;this amounts to saying that Bigelow is secretly plunging on
      the Board.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And this Le Duc, who is he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a cheap actor who married Bigelow's daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter! His oldest child is not a dozen years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By his present wife, yes. But he's been married before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll think this over, Mr. Halloran; I'll think it over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran rose. &ldquo;I came up here from Chicago to tell you that Bigelow is
      unsound. The sooner everybody connected with the Michigan lumber business
      finds it out the better for the business. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, sir.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III&mdash;Mr. Babcock's Last Card
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>s the feat of
      riding thirty horses around a circus hippodrome calls for the highest
      strength and skill, so the task of guiding the complicated affairs of
      Bigelow &amp; Company through the difficulties that threatened them
      demanded sound character and experience. For a time the Bigelow ventures
      had shown a persistent upward tendency, and the head of the firm had then
      made an imposing figure, but a fair-weather man was hardly adequate now.
      Kentucky Coal had slumped alarmingly; New Freighters had perhaps been
      overrated; and booming suburban real estate was discovering unexpected
      inertia where abnormal growth had been gambled on. But the most disturbing
      element was the lumber fight. That Higginson &amp; Company could not only
      hold out until the meeting, but could actually get the better of the
      Trust, had not been foreseen. Questions would be asked at this meeting:
      there might even be some tension. And so it was that Mr. Bigelow was not
      joking much nowadays. And so it was that Mr. Babcock took his grip from
      behind the door and went to Wauchung.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air blew keen from the West as Mr. Babcock walked swiftly out toward
      the Wauchung bridge. It was a crisp, invigorating breeze, with the
      strength of the lake in it, and a faint odour of pine. Men grow rugged and
      hardy in this region, whether they follow blaze-marks or mariner's
      compass. No malaria oozes from the dry white sand; the children rather
      draw from it the sap that makes the pine tree tall and sound. If you had
      strayed into the forest in the earlier time of reckless cutting; if you
      had stood under the tight green roof on a scented rug of needles, finer
      than ever came from India, and listened to the song of the shanty-boy as
      he struck his peavey into a bleeding trunk, could you have wondered at the
      lilt in his melody, at the vigour, even the harshness in his voice? Stand
      near a mill-race and watch the &ldquo;boys&rdquo; racing down, each balanced on a
      single careening log, and you will have a glimpse of the sort of men G.
      Hyde Bigelow &amp; Company were fighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Babcock passed the last straggling buildings of Wauchung's main street
      and found himself in full view of the bridge, the river and the
      lumber-yards. The sight did not please him, apparently, for he paused with
      knit brows to take it in. Beyond, showing here and there, lay the harbour,
      glistening in the cool light&mdash;and beyond the harbour the bald dunes
      and the lake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sky was blue, frayed here and there into ends of white clouds&mdash;the
      glorious northern sky, matched only in the air of Naples or Touraine. But
      Mr. Babcock was not looking at the sky. His soul was tuned to lower things&mdash;to
      lumber, for instance, heaps of it, piles of it, rows of it, stretched for
      hundreds of yards along the river, and across the peninsula, and along the
      edge of the harbour. The mills were silent; the watchmen were not to be
      seen; the only sign of life was the smoke curling from the funnels of the
      <i>Number One</i>, where Robbie MacGregor was dozing on the engine-room
      bench and hourly growing fatter. Six million feet of lumber greeted the
      eye of the man from Chicago, as he looked&mdash;and looked. It was new
      lumber, bought by experts, every stick of it such as would command a good
      price when the owners should throw it on the market, as they certainly
      would sooner or later. He shook his head and hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found Halloran at the office and shook hands cordially. Crosman heard
      the name, looked blank, recollected himself, and slipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've got a great lot of lumber here, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; Babcock began
      softly, glancing out the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How much can you keep in the yards here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have about twenty-five million feet in now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so! Your own cutting?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been&mdash;er&mdash;buying in the market, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all we could get.&rdquo; He could not resist adding, &ldquo;It's been a good
      time to buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so it has, so it has. I suppose you're holding this lot for a better
      price?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran nodded. His eyes were searching the face of his caller. Babcock
      paused to gather his forces, then settled back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like telling you, Mr. Halloran, that you've done a mighty neat
      piece of work. To tell the truth, it's been a surprise to us to see how
      well you've carried this business. Your fame now&rdquo;&mdash;he leaned forward
      and dropped his voice to a confidential pitch&mdash;&ldquo;your fame now,
      however, rests even more on the way you've stuck to your employer's
      interests than on the cleverness of what you've done. There are clever men
      enough, but down in Chicago we don't see any too many honest ones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This fight has been expensive, but it's taught us one lesson, I think.
      When we organized the lumber producers we tried to get all the good firms
      into it. We succeeded with every one but Higginson &amp; Company. By the
      facts of the case we were forced to antagonize you, and I'll tell you
      right here we expected to beat you. But we haven't beaten you. You've
      shown a vitality that was surprising. And since your owner, we understand,
      has been dangerously ill for some months, we are forced to believe that
      you, yourself, Mr. Halloran, are the real head of this business. Isn't
      that so? Well, you needn't answer. I understand your modesty. But there
      are the facts. Well, now, sir, here we are, after a hard fight, just where
      we were when we started. I don't know but what you may be better off.
      Anyhow, you're the one man that has kept us from doing what we want to do.
      What we've learned in this experience is, that we can't afford to go on
      fighting Mr. John Halloran. We need just such a man as you on our side.
      Mr. Bigelow and I have talked this all over, and I think we have insight
      enough to know that when a rising man, a really big man, comes along, it's
      a heap sight better to get on his side. You can't stop a man like that&mdash;he's
      bound to rise&mdash;and if you don't keep his good-will and confidence,
      you lose. Now, we want your good-will and confidence, Mr. Halloran. I've
      got some propositions to lay before&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Babcock. If you have come to propose that anybody but M.
      L. Higginson &amp; Company conduct this business, you'll be wasting your
      time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babcock looked thoughtful, then nimbly changed front. &ldquo;We have no concern
      in this or any business except our own. But we are interested in men.
      There's no doubt about it, Mr. Halloran&mdash;I know how men feel all over
      Michigan&mdash;there's no doubt about it, you're the coming man in the
      lumber business, to-day. Now, good men, Mr. Halloran, command good
      positions. Take this place you're in&mdash;it's a salaried position, isn't
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now&rdquo;&mdash;Mr. Babcock's voice had dropped almost to a whisper, but
      his intensity, his determination to win, trembled in every note of it. He
      was smiling. &ldquo;Well, now, what's the use of this, Mr. Halloran; what future
      have you here? Even if you succeed Mr. Higginson? You can never be more
      than he is, if you stay here. But once put a man of your caliber in a
      place that's big enough for him and he'll expand&mdash;he'll fill it&mdash;he'll
      reach out and up. In ten years, perhaps, you'd be at the head of the
      business. But you ought to be at the head <i>now</i>&mdash;then, in ten
      years, you'd be in Chicago or New York, with your finger on the pulse of
      the financial world. I'm here for a reason. We've started in to organize
      the lumber business and nothing can stop us. It may take time; we know it
      will take men. But we aren't bothering about the time; we're looking for
      the men. That's our way. And you're the man we need to make it go; you're
      the man that can do it&mdash;you have a genius for it. Now&mdash;one
      moment&mdash;I told you I had some propositions to make to you, and I'm
      ready to make them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was playing the last card in the hand of Bigelow &amp; Company, and
      playing it beautifully. A few short weeks and the meeting would be upon
      them&mdash;the meeting when explanations of the delay in completing the
      organization would fall upon unsympathetic ears. He was thinking now, for
      one moment, with his eyes half closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, Mr. Halloran, that Mr. Bigelow is the owner of the Pewaukoe
      Mills. It is a first-class plant in every way&mdash;and slightly larger
      than this, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A little, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, I could make you other propositions, but you know the lumber
      business, and I suppose you'd rather stay in it until you've got your hand
      worked in with something a little bigger. I offer you this: We'll put you
      at the head of our Pewaukoe business, with entire authority, subject only
      to consultation with the firm on matters of policy and development. We
      want you to go in with the idea that your hands are free&mdash;that you
      can stamp your own individuality on the business. Don't you see, Mr.
      Halloran, it's that individuality, that business character, that we want
      above all? We want the qualities that have given you your peculiar success
      here. As to payment, that will be arranged easiest of all. You know best
      what you ought to have. But I'll name a figure, merely by way of opening
      the discussion&mdash;&mdash;-&rdquo; He smiled again. &ldquo;Suppose I say we'll pay
      you a thousand dollars a year more than you're getting here, whatever that
      may be. If that doesn't seem fair, just say so. We want to enter these new
      relations with the feeling of perfect satisfaction all around&mdash;we
      can't afford to do it any other way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;- Don't commit yourself hurriedly.
      This is a matter for consideration. First of all, let me put that offer
      down in writing over our signature&mdash;then we'll have something to work
      from. Will you call your stenographer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have no stenographer here now. But let me say&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll write it out&mdash;here, this letter-paper will do the
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, see here, we can't talk along this line. I haven't the slightest
      intention of leaving Higginson &amp; Company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Take plenty of time to think it
      over. I'll go ahead and put this down in black and white&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Babcock. I won't consider it at all. I stay right here at this
      desk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babcock brought up his reserves. &ldquo;You are inclined to think,&rdquo; he said,
      settling back again, &ldquo;that your place is here with Mr. Higginson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see. Perhaps we've been working a little at cross-purposes. I haven't
      been talking with the idea of taking away Mr. Higginson's main support at
      the time he needs it most. I'm afraid I haven't been looking at that side
      of it quite enough. You see, Mr. Halloran, we're business men, we of G. H.
      Bigelow &amp; Company. When we see a big man in our line we want him; and
      when we try to get him, I suppose we don't always consider the other
      people who want him, too. We haven't time. But I'm glad you brought the
      point up. Suppose we go at it from a new point of view. Now, I recognize
      (and Mr. Bigelow would agree with me if he were here) that this very
      attitude of yours&mdash;this standing by your employer when he's a sick
      man&mdash;is the quality in you we like best. We've seen it before; we've
      talked about it. If you should go back on Mr. Higginson now&mdash;even
      though, of course, there's not the slightest legal hindrance to your
      looking out for yourself&mdash;how could we know you wouldn't go back on
      us some day? But you won't go back on him, you see, and that's how we know
      more than ever that you're the man we're after. Now there's not the
      slightest need of any immediate change. We could even date your salary
      from this moment, or back to the beginning of this month, without
      expecting you to walk right out here&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no use&mdash;I'm not going to leave.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm not suggesting such a thing. I was going to say that&mdash;that
      we're looking ahead. Let me see&mdash;you're about thirty, perhaps. Why,
      man, you haven't begun yet. But if you stay here, and if Mr. Higginson
      should die within these next few years without taking you into the firm,
      you'd have nothing whatever to show for your work. Now, one place is as
      good as another for such a man as you. All you need is to get a footing&mdash;but
      that takes capital. My suggestion would be that you stay right here and
      buy into the business&mdash;get it into your own hands. Mr. Higginson,
      knowing you as he does, would be only too glad to have it go to you. We
      can help you with that. Your credit is A-1 with us. We're so sure you're
      going to see some day the advantages of combination and cooperation in
      this business that we'll write you a check any day and no questions asked.
      It&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think,&rdquo; said Halloran, speaking slowly, with an edge on his
      voice, &ldquo;don't you think you've said about enough?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babcock flushed. &ldquo;What do you mean by that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean, if your time's worth anything to you you're losing money here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you are not interested&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The junior partner of Bigelow &amp; Company, still flushing, rose. &ldquo;I've
      made you a square offer&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I've refused it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Babcock stood looking down at Halloran. His eyes were growing smaller; his
      fingers were restless. For a moment he seemed not to grasp the fact that
      he had failed. Halloran picked up a letter, then lowered it, and looked up
      inquiringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now suppose we leave it this way for the present, Mr. Halloran.&rdquo; He was
      rallying. &ldquo;You'd better just think over what I've said. The main thing is
      to pave the way toward an agreement, and I think we've done that. I'm glad
      to have had this talk with you. Don't hurry about deciding. Weigh it
      carefully. Good-by&mdash;glad to have seen you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran gave him a nod and he was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was to be a day rather more than usually eventful. Before he left the
      office, in the afternoon, Crosman drew him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo; he began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you be home to-night&mdash;about eight?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so. Why, anything special?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no. You'll be there sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Promptly at eight the doorbell rang and Halloran was called down to the
      parlour. Entering, he found Crosman, grinning feverishly; and over in the
      corner, with her back turned, looking at a picture, was Mamie. He looked
      from one to the other until Mamie turned around and disclosed a very red
      face. Still no one spoke. The two now gazed appealingly at each other, and
      finally it was Mamie who broke the silence with a preliminary giggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess&mdash;I guess you can congratulate us, Mr. Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Coming so suddenly, even this bold statement did not sink at once into
      Halloran's consciousness. But at last, after a painful pause, he
      recollected himself and shook hands cordially. And then the story had to
      be told in detail. It was all a secret, for Mrs. Higginson had not yet
      learned to understand Harry as she would when she came to know him as one
      of the family. During the worst of her father's illness Mamie would not
      consent, but now that the crisis was turned she had&mdash;&ldquo;Well, she had
      supposed she might as well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We wanted you to know it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;And it's going to be a secret
      between just you and us. We thought maybe&mdash;you&mdash;maybe you'd be
      glad, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But for some reason it did not have that effect; for an hour later, when
      Halloran was striding up the beach to the north, heedless of the waves
      that ran up about his feet, of the west wind that slapped his face and
      tugged at his coat, he wore a far from glad expression. And not until he
      had fallen into step with the night patrol from the life-saving station,
      and had swapped yams of the old Inspector and the Beebe-McClellan boat and
      the capsize-drill records, and had learned precisely why the Wauchung
      Station was the most abused and discriminated against in the whole U. S.
      L. S. S., did he seem a little more composed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV&mdash;Twelve, Midnight
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he deep-toned bell
      in the town hall was striking twelve. It was a still, overcast night, with
      a mild breeze blowing up from the head of Lake Michigan. Three men stood
      at the gate of the yards talking in low tones, somewhat oppressed,
      perhaps, by the silence. Before them, a little way, was the white circle
      thrown by the electric light over the bridge; behind were the great dim
      piles of lumber with the narrow alleys between, now black as the sky, and
      carpeted as they were with chips and shavings, as silent beneath the foot
      as velvet. The only noise came, in the intervals between words, from the
      two steamers that lay breathing softly alongside the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you doin' on watch, Du Bois? Changed your job?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mr. Halloran asked me to go on to-night. He says it's time we had
      some good men down here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aw, go on!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Runyon, who's that on the bridge?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All three watched a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno 'im. Throw your lantern on 'im when he goes by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the fellow turned in at the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm George Bigelow. Mr. Halloran said I could go on watch at twelve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigelow ain't a very safe name around here, sonny. How about it, Du
      Bois?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right, I guess. He's the new lumber-checker.&rdquo; They all laughed.
      &ldquo;You understand, don't you, boy, that if a man's caught sleeping or off
      his post he gets shot?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't let 'im scare you, sonny. He's the lazy beggar 'imself. Say, Du
      Bois, I thought I saw a tramp hanging around about an hour ago. If you
      want to look through the yards once more with me I'll stay for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take the boy. It'll learn him the ropes. Run along, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Runyon. I won't wait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They separated, one man hurrying off for home and a bed, Du Bois lingering
      at the gate for a look up and down the line of the fence; Runyon and
      George, their lanterns darkened, slipping stealthily away into the shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seen somethin' over there by the mill,&rdquo; said Runyon, in a subdued
      voice, &ldquo;like it was a tramp that had dumb the fence by the bridge and was
      sneakin' along the bank. Here, now, hold on a minute,&rdquo;&mdash;he caught the
      boy's arm&mdash;&ldquo;I was a-standin' right here. Now look down between them
      piles&mdash;past the mill. See that little strip o' the river where the
      bridge light's a-shinin'? It looked to me like somethin' black went acrost
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on, giving a quarter of an hour to winding through the alleys,
      throwing a light into every dark corner. &ldquo;A feller can't be expected to
      see everything&mdash;not in yards as big as these here. We needn't go out
      around the P'int. I guess there ain't nothin'. Here's Du Bois a-waitin' by
      the <i>Number One</i>. I'll leave you with him. You got a whistle, ain't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; Mr. Halloran gave me one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know about it? If you blow, it means fire. So don't get gay with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hallo, there,&rdquo; said Du Bois, as they joined him on the wharf in the
      little patch of light that fell from the steamer's engine-room. &ldquo;You're
      purty poor. Where's your tramp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't to home. We 'lowed we'd call again. So long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The engine-room was snug and comfortable, a capital headquarters for
      patrol duty. So the old Inspector took immediate precedence of his
      associate. &ldquo;Now, young man, we'll have to break you in first thing. You
      better go over and patrol the fence f'r'n hour. Then you come back here
      and report. Be kind o' cautiouslike about your whistle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess you don't&mdash;not such a dam sight. What's the matter? What
      you waitin' f'r?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;when we was going around the yards, he said he guessed we
      wouldn't go out as fur's the Point&mdash;and I thought mebbe I'd go now,
      jes so's to be sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you've took to thinkin', eh? I s'pose you was a-thinkin' you'd send me
      over to the fence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't mean to send you, but I thought mebbe&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Git along with you. You talk too much. You make me sick.&rdquo; And the
      Inspector, with a chuckle, made slowly toward the gate, leaving the boy to
      his own resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      George walked to the end of the wharf and stood a moment, debating whether
      to keep on along the bank or to turn in among the lumber-piles. He decided
      on the latter course and crowded through, with the help of his lantern, by
      crawling over and under the projecting ends of planks between two huge
      piles. This brought him into an alley that led, with one turn, to the
      narrow space of open ground at the end of the peninsula. He closed his
      lantern and felt his way along. He had nearly reached the turn, he
      thought, when it was suddenly revealed to him by a light flickering on the
      lumber. He stopped short and held his breath. The light was growing
      rapidly. He rushed forward around the turn&mdash;and again he stopped. A
      blaze that had evidently started at the base of a pile of inch stuff was
      now curling upward, was already half way up to the top; and it crackled
      ominously as it wreathed around the thin, resinous boards. Standing a
      little way off at the edge of the bank, looking stupidly at the fire, was
      the worst specimen from the land of trampdom George had ever seen. His
      clothing hung about him in rags, his hair and beard were grizzled and
      matted, his face was red; and his whole body seemed to tremble as if from
      a nervous affection. He looked up frantically, called out something in a
      husky voice and held up a blackened clay pipe, then, on an impulse, he
      dropped the pipe, turned and dove out into the river. There was a splash,
      the firelight glistened for an instant on the spray, and he had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      George remembered his whistle and blew it sharply half a dozen times His
      first thought was to turn back to the steamer, and he had taken a few
      steps when a shout told him that his signal was heard, that probably the
      fire could be seen now, for it was already licking at the topmost boards;
      and so he threw his lantern away and took a running dive off the bank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Du Bois, walking slowly, had nearly reached the gate when he heard
      George's whistle. &ldquo;The boy's crazy,&rdquo; he muttered. &ldquo;Wonder they wouldn't
      give us unweaned infants f'r patrol.&rdquo; He looked down the centre roadway,
      but could see no light. However, his duty was obvious, and he turned and
      ran back to the wharf, growling as he went. The men were aroused on both
      steamers. As he passed the <i>Number Two</i> he saw the hands dragging out
      a coil of hose with the nozzle ready attached. On the upper deck of the <i>Number
      One</i> Captain Craig, with a pair of trousers hastily drawn on and his
      nightgown partly tucked in at the waist, was leaning on the rail and
      peering out over the yards. The deckhouse door was open, throwing the
      light on him. In the fainter light, on the main deck, MacGregor was
      hanging out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is it, Cap'n?&rdquo; he was calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Captain made a sign of impatience, straightened up and shaded his eyes
      with one hand to shut off the light from the steamer; then gave a shout,
      and pointing toward the end of the peninsula, he plunged into the
      wheel-house and pulled the whistle-cord. MacGregor disappeared in the
      engine-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the moment Du Bois was midway between the two steamers running along
      the wharf. He stopped now and retraced a few steps. &ldquo;Hi, there!&rdquo; he called
      to the men who were at work on the <i>Number Two</i>, &ldquo;uncouple that hose
      and bring 'er up to the <i>Number One</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for? You&mdash;you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Hi, Cap'n Craig! I'm
      a-bringin' up the Number Two's line&mdash;&mdash; Will you have yours
      uncoupled for us? Now, you louts, gimme a hold o' the line. All together,
      now! <i>Heave</i> f'r it! Over the rail with 'er! Lay hold now, lively!
      Did you think you was a-sprinklin' the front yard <i>an</i> the tulip-bed?
      Ryan, if you fall over them feet of yourn again I'll be darned if I don't
      soak you. All together, now!&mdash; right in the solar plexus, b' th'
      divvel. Now <i>heave!</i> HEAVE! What's the trouble, there. Damn that
      Ryan! Say, you've got more feet to the square inch than any man a-walkin'.
      Here she is, Cap'n. Take off that nozzle, one o' you, while I couple 'er.
      Hold on, Robbie, we'll holler when we want water. Jest heave that Ryan
      overboard, a couple o' you. All right, Cap'n. Will we take the nozzle?
      Here we go, now! Run 'er out! Quick, there&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;You're the
      craziest lot o' hare-lipped bungholes I ever see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were stretching out the hose to its fullest extent, but they were
      still some distance from the fire that now was roaring and crackling
      before them. Already they could hear the wind, swelling from a night
      breeze; it was whipping the flames into madness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hi! Robbie! Let 'er go! Pass the word there Let 'er go!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The men shouted; MacGregor responded; the flat line of hose swelled and
      writhed as the water was forced through. &ldquo;Hold hard, Cap'n!&rdquo; The nozzle
      was almost wrenched from their hands; the stream rushed out and curved
      high over the lumber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we a-gettin' at it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think so. I can't see. Here, work out into the roadway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, no, we ain't reachin' 'er by three rods. An' she's a-burnin' to
      beat the yellow devils. What's the matter with the boys? Damn it, they
      must think we're a-doin' it f'r fun! This ain't no Fourth o' July
      pyrotechnics.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They'll be here. It's not much more'n a minute since George signaled.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's some more of the boys, I think.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see much&mdash;this light's in my eyes. It's no use trying to
      reach it. Here, let's wet down these here piles. That's good. Now hold her
      there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gettin' pretty hot here, Cap'n.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't help that. It'll be hotter before we get through. Have an eye out
      to see that we don't get cut off behind. Here come the buckets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here you are, boys&mdash;this way! How many is they of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno&mdash;about a dozen, I guess. The boys is comin' right in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Form a line here along the road. If you keep your clothes wet there's no
      danger, I guess. Stir along, now. Mr. Halloran come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Mr. Crosman's couplin' up the yard hose an' he'll be along
      here'n a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The fire was giving rise to the wind; the wind was lashing the fire. The
      crackling was loud now; the roar made it hard to talk. As they worked and
      watched a gust of wind came sweeping across the harbour, and catching up
      the top row of boards from an exposed pile, it tossed them, burning, high
      in the air. The sparks were flying high, coursing the length of the yards,
      some falling far beyond. Men were pouring into the yards. Somewhere across
      the river the town fire-engine was clanging out toward the bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      A man, hatless, in a purple sweater, carrying a tin pail in each hand,
      came running through the gate and down the central roadway. Some one
      shouted &ldquo;Here he comes!&rdquo; and here and there other men, working with hose
      or bucket, heard the shout and caught it up for sheer excitement, heedless
      of the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; said Du Bois. &ldquo;It's all clear behind, ain't it? We ain't
      cut off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; we aren't cut off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Cap'n, I can't stand this; let's drop back a step or so. Lord knows
      we ain't doin' much good here. See her burn! I guess it's all day with
      Higginson &amp; Company. Here come the fire boys&mdash;I see a helmet back
      there&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;No, they've quit. They're a-runnin' back,
      an' draggin' their hose with 'em. Who's this here a-comin' f'r us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know; I can't see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's himself&mdash;it's Mr. Halloran. Hi! What's that?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Back with you, quick!&rdquo; Halloran was shouting. &ldquo;Never mind the hose. Let
      it go. You'll have to run for it. One's enough here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good Lord, he's goin' to try the dynamite. Hold on, there, Mr. Halloran!
      You'll never make it; the fire's too close.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Get back there!</i> What do you mean by talking back to me?&rdquo;
       Halloran's eyes were blazing. &ldquo;Get back or I'll throw you back Drop that
      hose, Cap'n. Don't say a word!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Cap'n. I guess we can get the hose back with us. Heave, now!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran jerked it away from them, took the Captain by the shoulders and
      spun him around. &ldquo;I'll give you three seconds to get to the gate. Now <i>get!</i>
      And none of your talk!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They ran, without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire had eaten its way almost to the widening of the peninsula, almost
      to the last point where the dynamite could be expected to stop it. A
      narrow strip could be blasted out, but once the flames had swept on into
      the main yards nothing could check them. The steamers were far enough
      away, Halloran thought, to be safe; and he had warned all the men back.
      They stood now at the gate, waiting. The watchmen and deckhands were
      there, and the twenty- or thirty amateur and the dozen professional
      fire-fighters. Crosman came hurrying over from the mill-plug and addressed
      himself to the Wauchung chief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have your boys run the hose right down the minute you hear the second
      explosion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There'll be only two?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only two. I've got my hose ready to take down the other road. The rest of
      you boys be ready with your buckets, and when the Chief here gives the
      word you run for it, every one of you. Understand?&rdquo; Then he hurried back
      to his station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he comes,&rdquo; said a Wauchung fireman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Down the narrow roadway they could see a black figure running. Nearer he
      came, his shadow leaping grotesquely before. And just as he reached them
      and put out his hand to check his progress, the whole south end of the
      yards seemed to rise high in the air&mdash;once, and then again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come on, boys,&rdquo; called Halloran, turning before he had fairly caught his
      breath. &ldquo;Cap'n, go to the steamer and see that she's all right. This way,
      boys!&rdquo; Eager hands laid hold of the hose and ran forward with it. Over by
      the mills they could hear Crosman urging his men on. And ahead of all was
      the bucket brigade.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explosion had cleared a path from bank to bank. Many of the blazing
      timbers had fallen into the yards, but the buckets and Crosman's hose were
      turned on these, while the firemen gave their attention to the wide heap
      of débris that seemed on the point of blazing up again. A third line of
      hose was soon brought up, and within a quarter of an hour the Chief had
      the satisfaction of saying to Halloran, &ldquo;We've got her in hand now.&rdquo; An
      hour more and the fire was over, excepting the smouldering piles, on which
      streams of water would be kept for the rest of the night. Halloran
      assigned a few men to stay on watch with the firemen and, leaving the
      responsibility in the hands of the Chief, he went over to the <i>Number
      One</i>. Craig was on the wharf.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any harm done, Cap'n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;not to speak of. About all the glass is broken, and some sparks
      came aboard, but we put them out easy enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, Cap'n, I don't know just what I said to you to-night&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Mr. Halloran&mdash;don't you speak of it. You were
      tending to your business, that was all. You haven't seen anything of
      George, have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;George? No. Isn't he here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain't. He was out at the Point. He gave us the signal, but he
      didn't come back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here, we'll look into this. Du Bois, there, did you see George
      after he gave the alarm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain't seen 'im since he went out to the P'int. What's the matter,
      ain't he around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he hasn't been seen. Look him up, will you? Ask the boys, and look
      around the yards a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here he is now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Craig and the Manager turned and saw, sure enough, George, leading, with
      the assistance of a local policeman, a villainous-looking tramp. George
      himself looked almost as disreputable as the tramp, and the policeman had
      evidently not been treading paths of ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's the man that done it, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; said George excitedly. &ldquo;The
      copper said he didn't mind bringing him here so's you could see him before
      he gets run in. He won't say nothing, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran soon drew out George's story, but the tramp was silent, beyond
      claiming stoutly that he had been smoking and had fallen asleep, only to
      awake and find the flames starting up. There was nothing to do but to turn
      him over to the law for the present. And at last, as the hour crept on
      toward two o'clock in the morning, Halloran and Crosman, after sending a
      reassuring message to the Higginsons, left the yards together for home and
      bed.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V&mdash;The Meeting
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ne afternoon young
      Corrigan appeared at the office. &ldquo;I wish you would repeat,&rdquo; he said, when
      the civilities had been exchanged, &ldquo;what you said to me a little while
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About Mr. Bigelow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Please tell me just what you think, and why you think so. You
      understand that I couldn't go on with this without pretty good authority
      behind me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have no documentary proof, if that's what you mean. But to my notion,
      that isn't necessary.&rdquo; And Halloran simply repeated his former statements.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me again about this Le Duc&mdash;what is his relationship to Mr.
      Bigelow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I may as well give you the whole story, Mr. Corrigan. The daughter of our
      Captain Craig went to Chicago some twenty years ago as Bigelow's private
      secretary. They were married and had two children, and then they were
      divorced. The courts allowed Mrs. Bigelow a decent income by way of
      alimony, most of which was never paid, and in some letters Bigelow
      admitted that it was unpaid. A little while ago, Le Duc, a fellow I had
      known in college, who had drifted on the stage and was rather up against
      it, married the daughter, Elizabeth Bigelow. They were all poor&mdash;Mrs.
      Bigelow (or Mrs. Craig, as she is now known) was really in want&mdash;and
      finally Le Duc got the letters from her and went out one evening to
      Evanston to demand money from Bigelow. Instead of giving it to him,
      Bigelow bought him off by offering him a position as the nominal head of
      the corner he was contemplating on the Board. Le Duc accepted, kept the
      letters, and cast off Mrs. Craig, who is now living here in Wauchung with
      her father. Just before I saw you he told me himself that Bigelow was the
      man behind him in his operations. That's the story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;well,&rdquo; observed Corrigan, with a distressed expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And in telling it to you, I'm assuming that you don't want a Board of
      Trade plunger at the head of your combination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, of course we don't. Now, Mr. Halloran, what is it exactly that
      you have to suggest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say to Mr. Bigelow at your meeting that you have been told that he is
      behind the corner and request an explanation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he can explain, well and good. You can refer the whole matter to me.
      But if he can't&mdash;there you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corrigan pondered. &ldquo;That seems fair. I'll talk it over with my father. I'm
      much obliged to you, anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reaction had followed the fire and the long strain leading up to it.
      They all felt it. Crosman, wearied by the comparative idleness that was
      forced upon him, was irritable and inclined to chafe against the steady
      disapproval of Mrs. Higginson. Halloran was plunged in gloom most of the
      time. And to add to the depression Captain Craig decided to give up his
      post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; he said, in speaking of it, &ldquo;you maybe wouldn't
      think to look at me that I'm a great-grandfather, but I've known it by my
      feelings since the fire. I didn't stand it very well&mdash;the running and
      the wet and all; and my eyes have been bothering me, too. Jennie and me,
      we've been talking it over, and she thinks I ought to just quit now, and
      look after the garden, and take it kind of easy. There's no room for us
      old fellows now, anyhow. A man had better make up his mind to it before he
      gets crowded out. I've saved a little something&mdash;enough to live on,
      and I've got my place, and I guess that's enough for anybody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're mistaken, Captain. There's not a better man on the Lakes, and I'm
      glad to tell you so. The <i>Number One</i> is yours as long as you'll keep
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in the Captain's eyes. &ldquo;That's all right&mdash;I'm
      obliged to you. But I guess it's time to quit now while we're shut down
      and you have a good chance to look around for somebody else. There's only
      one thing that's been bothering me. Do you think you're going to have a
      place for George?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure of it. He's going to make a good man before he gets through with
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you think so. I must tell Jennie&mdash;it'll please her. And say&mdash;here's
      a little something&mdash;George says he's owed you three-fifty for a long
      while. He's managed to save it up now, and he wanted me to hand it to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had to think. &ldquo;Oh, that&mdash;that's nothing&mdash;I couldn't
      take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you don't mind&mdash;I think you'd better. And I&mdash;I want to say,
      Mr. Halloran, before I quit you, that it's been a great thing for Mr.
      Higginson to have you here. I guess there ain't no doubt you've saved his
      business for him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This brought the gloom back to the Manager's face. He shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right now&mdash;I've watched the business some. It's your
      nerve and grit&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Captain,&rdquo; Halloran broke in bitterly, &ldquo;I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I know what you mean. You've been carrying a load that would have
      broke most men, and now you're sort of unstrung.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran shook his head again. &ldquo;Damn the load.&rdquo; He looked around the
      office. Crosman was out; the door was shut. &ldquo;Captain, I've lost the girl I
      want to marry, for want of nerve.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is she married already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; she's gone away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Down East. She didn't leave word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she ain't married anybody else? Then she ain't lost. Why don't you go
      after her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. I've thought of that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thinking 'll never do it. You better go.&rdquo; Halloran looked up and caught
      the Captain's eye. It was beaming with good-will, and it opened to him a
      glimpse of a new world. &ldquo;I believe I will,&rdquo; he said, holding his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can get the eleven o'clock on the Père Marquette and connect with the
      Central Limited to-night at Detroit. I'll take care of the fire department
      while you're gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you?&rdquo; He caught at the Captain's hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. You'd better move right along&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Lord, yes,
      there's only twenty-five minutes, and it'll take you most of that to get
      home and pack. I'll call up the livery and have a carriage go right up
      after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good. Tell Crosman I've been called East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to everything. Good-by. And say, don't hurry back. Wire your
      address, and if we need you we'll let you know. Good-by. Good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thanks. Good-by.&rdquo; He was gone with a rush, leaving his desk open behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so chanced that on this morning when Halloran went plunging off to seek
      his fortune, Mr. G. Hyde Bigelow, in an equally uncertain frame of mind,
      was fronting <i>his</i>. Matters were going awry down in Chicago. The
      Board of Trade deal, thanks to the elation and consequent intermeddling of
      the paid figurehead, was wobbling dangerously. And at ten o'clock, while
      Le Duc was hearing sharp, straight-out words in the mahogany office, the
      heads of nearly a score of Michigan lumber firms were gathering in the
      city office of the Corrigans, not far away. Hard-headed old fellows they
      were, most of them&mdash;men with slouch hats and unkempt beards, men who
      wore high boots beneath their bagging trousers, and swore as they talked
      and breathed. And there they waited for Bigelow, to ask him where their
      money had gone and how he proposed to get it back. At length he came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, gentlemen,&rdquo; he observed, as he laid aside his coat and
      stick and his silk hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; came from Corrigan, and &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; from one or two
      others. One graybeard murmured to a neighbour that he wished he'd a known
      in the first place that Bigelow wore a silk hat. &ldquo;You can't trust a dude,&rdquo;
       he muttered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, gentlemen,&rdquo; the managing director began, drawing his report from
      his pocket, &ldquo;I suppose a statement of what we have accomplished will&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But young Corrigan couldn't wait. &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Bigelow&mdash;and
      gentlemen. I think we all know just about where we stand in this business.
      And&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment, Mr. Corrigan. It is usual&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What I have to say is not usual, Mr. Bigelow. It's so important that it
      takes precedence, to my notion. It concerns our existence as a working
      body and our relations with you, sir. And this meeting can't go forward
      until it has been laid before you, and you've had the chance to convince
      us that what has been reported to me is untrue&mdash;that it is, as we
      should hope, a malicious lie. Before we think of the question of going
      forward or backward as a combination we must settle the question of our
      mutual confidence as individuals. A shadow has been cast upon this
      confidence; and you know, every man of you&mdash;&rdquo; the graybeards, some
      startled, others condescending, looked at him; Bigelow looked at him, too&mdash;&ldquo;You
      know that our whole structure must rest on complete confidence in the men
      we choose to direct our affairs. If this is removed, we can't do business
      a day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should suggest, Mr. Corrigan, that what you have to say had better come
      in the discussion that will follow the reading of the report. It is the
      object of this report to answer in advance all inquiries, to tell every
      fact about our work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better wait, Harry,&rdquo; observed a man in boots. &ldquo;Let him read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If this were a fact of our work it could wait, sir; but it ain't.&rdquo;
       Corrigan was warming up. &ldquo;It concerns you, personally, Mr. Bigelow. We
      have accepted your guidance so far because we believed you to be a certain
      kind of a man, and to stand for certain principles in business. We want to
      go on believing this, and we don't want to wait a minute, now that we're
      all together here. I've been told that you're the real operator of the big
      corner on the Board, that your money is in it, and that the man named Le
      Duc has been put up so that your name wouldn't be known. Is that so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every face in the room changed expression. The blood rushed into
      Bigelow's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you've been taking our time to make wild charges against my character&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You aren't answering,&rdquo; shouted Corrigan. &ldquo;Tell me that. That's what I
      ask.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better cool down a bit, Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Anderson, I won't cool down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See here,&rdquo; said Bigelow, his voice rising with the others. &ldquo;This has
      nothing whatever to do with this meeting.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corrigan leaned over the table and looked him keenly in the eyes. &ldquo;If you
      mean to withdraw here and now, Mr. Bigelow, to dissolve this agreement,
      then I'm with you; it has nothing to do with it. But if you mean to go on
      as our managing director, then you've got to answer that question.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other men looked at one another. &ldquo;I guess that's fair, Mr. Bigelow,&rdquo;
       observed the man in boots. &ldquo;So long as Harry's sprung this on us we
      wouldn't any of us feel quite easy about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, is it true?&rdquo; asked Corrigan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I claim that this is impertinent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I decline to answer. My private investments are simply none of your
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Corrigan sank back in his chair and drew a long breath. &ldquo;There,&rdquo; he said,
      &ldquo;that's all I wanted to know. I think you'll agree with me, gentlemen,
      that we can't keep up these relations any longer. Suppose we hear the
      report now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was half-past two when the door was opened and a score of heated,
      hungry men came out for lunch. Bigelow had recovered and made a strong
      fight, but the sentiment was overwhelmingly against him. The managership
      had been offered to Corrigan; he had declined and stood out for
      dissolution on the ground that during the dozen or fifteen years that
      remained before the timber should be all cut out there was room for them
      all without any damaging competition. And so before they broke up the
      lumber agreement was abrogated. And in a few days, as soon as matters
      could be settled, the lumber world would know it.
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>astward sped
      Halloran, on to the Hudson, on up the crooked mountain railroad to the
      junction village, on up the wagon road behind a team of crawling white
      horses; reaching at last the house perched on the mountainside, lost in
      billows of autumn flame. Yes, Miss Davies was still there. The wife of the
      proprietor had seen her shortly before, walking up the trail behind the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found her standing in a tangle of late blackberries, hatless, her
      sleeves rolled to the elbow, reaching up to break off a crimson maple
      branch. She heard him crashing through brake and bramble, and turned. He
      did not see that she changed colour, she was so browned by the mountain
      sun&mdash;but she was startled. She did not move, but stood, holding the
      branch and looking at him without a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; he said, shaking hands. &ldquo;Hardly expected to see me, did
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. This is a surprise. When did you get here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you're just in time to walk back with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was disappointed. &ldquo;Don't go right down. I came because they told me you
      were here, and now it would be too bad not to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to play tennis, and there's only an hour before dark. Here, you
      may carry these branches. Aren't they beautiful? You walk ahead so I can
      look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no other way; the trail was narrow, and with the great bundle of
      branches in his arms he had all he could do to pick his way down the rocky
      path. Near the house they were met by a big young man in flannels,
      carrying tennis rackets. He looked curiously at Halloran, and passing him,
      walked with Miss Davies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Mr. Green.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Green bowed and said, &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; with an eastern drawl. And that
      was the last Halloran saw of her until supper time. He might have sat on
      the veranda and watched the game, but he did not; instead, he walked down
      to the road, and in the same plunging mood that had brought him East he
      went swinging up the valley. The bold splashes of crimson and yellow and
      golden brown on the long slopes, brought sharply out by the somber pines;
      the fringe of Queen Anne's lace along the road, and the masses of
      goldenrod and mint; the hum of millions of bees; the tumbling brook a rod
      away, with its pebbly ripples and dark pools; these he hardly saw. Even
      the Wittenberg, standing rugged against the sky, its crown of balsams now
      a trembling, luminous purple under the shafts of the setting sun, could
      not move him.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper, by some managing, he caught her alone in the hall. &ldquo;Come,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;let's go outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, but yielded. &ldquo;I can't stay out but a minute. It's too
      cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get a wrap or something. If you bundle up we could sit awhile. It's
      stuffy in there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I can't. We're going to play euchre to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, everybody. That means you, too, of course. Come in and let me
      introduce you. The people are jolly, most of them. There are always some
      queer ones, you know, at a place like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Margaret, I didn't come to play euchre. I don't want to know these
      people. Can't you see? I came on purpose to see you, and to talk to you.
      Get your things and take a walk with me. Never mind the euchre.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no, I couldn't do that. The people&mdash;it wouldn't look right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do we care for them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mustn't. We had really better go in.&rdquo; And in she went, with
      Halloran, crestfallen, following.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an insufferable evening he tried again to see her, and again it was
      accomplished only by maneuvering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he said, when he had drawn her into the corner of the emptying
      room, &ldquo;tell me what it means. What's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him and slowly shook her head. &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; she replied;
      &ldquo;nothing at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you get my letters?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know&mdash;you didn't answer. Why didn't you write, Margaret?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you tell me? I've come a long way to ask you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;why, I just couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you have anything to say to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't believe I did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have you nothing to say to me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A long, long silence. Then this from Miss Davies:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, please don't now. It's very late&mdash;and I'm tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But when am I to see you?&rdquo; he broke out impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there will be plenty of time. But not to-night&mdash;please. You
      aren't going away before morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am here only for a day or so. I&mdash;I am down East on&mdash;on
      business.&rdquo; He had quailed again. &ldquo;I just stopped off here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you just happened to come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I meant to come&mdash;I had to, I couldn't stay away. It's a long
      time since I've seen you, Margaret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know. You called in Evanston, didn't you? Mrs. Bigelow wrote me that
      you had taken George. How is he doing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. But when can I talk with you&mdash;alone somewhere? I can't say
      anything when you seem so hurried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;to-morrow, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not the morning. I'm going to climb the Terrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not drop that and come with me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't. I promised Mr. Green. He's getting up a party. You&mdash;you
      might come along.&rdquo; He shook his head. There was another pause. &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo;
       he said then, &ldquo;who is Mr. Green?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a Boston man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he&mdash;is he&mdash;&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Some one was looking for Miss Davies. &ldquo;She's in the card-room, I think,&rdquo;
       said a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here I am. I'll be there directly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait, Margaret. Do you plan to get back for lunch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I don't think we're going to take any with us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll order a carriage for two o'clock, and we'll drive.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course&rdquo;&mdash;and every word he uttered sounded like &ldquo;Mr. Green&mdash;Mr.
      Green&rdquo;&mdash;&ldquo;of course, if you'd rather not&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no&mdash;thank you very much. I'd enjoy going. At two, did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone; and Halloran went outside and paced the veranda, alone with
      a cigar. His regular footfall sounded for a long time&mdash;during two
      cigars, in fact; and the thoughts he finally carried to bed with him were
      not the sort to put him into a condition for the diplomacy the morrow was
      to demand. In the morning, long before daylight he was up and dressed. He
      breakfasted late to avoid the climbing party, and from his window he
      watched them start up the road. He saw Green take Margaret's jacket and
      tie the sleeves through his belt. An annoying fellow he was with his easy
      manners, his faultless clothes, his calm reserve. He grated on Halloran;
      he reminded him of his own blunt western way; he forced him to recall
      again those rough antecedents of his. And that Halloran was keen enough to
      recognize the difference, indefinable as it seemed, aggravated matters.
      For an hour or so he sat in the library and tried to read, but failed. He
      thought a little fresh air might fix him up, and he went out for a
      six-mile tramp up the Panther Kill, through the ravine where the rock
      walls shine with moisture, and the trout lie deep in the pools below the
      falls, and the trees mat closely to shut out the day; but this was worse
      than the book. He came back over a spur of the Panther Mountain and here
      he had his first occupation of the day, scrambling up the ledges, fighting
      through the brambles, placing his feet carefully on the treacherous
      moss-covered rocks; here drawing himself by a finger grip up a sheer
      precipice, there elbowing up a chimney.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the top of the ridge and plunged down through the forest. He
      saw a clearing ahead, and, pushing on, found the whole valley spread out
      below, the stream splashing and glittering in the sun, the white road
      winding out here and there from the shelter of the trees, and all the
      tumbling mountain land blazing with colour. To the south towered the
      Wittenberg, to the north lay the peaceful slopes of North Dome and Mount
      Sheridan. He was knee-deep in fragrant mint, and surrounded by droning
      bees. A look, and he was crashing on, covered with thistledown from the
      tangle of brush. It was a pleasure to jump the great hemlock logs that the
      tanners had left to rot thirty years before. Once a birch of six inches
      diameter snapped off short under his hand and gave him a tumble and a roll
      down the slope. He got up, shook out his joints and went on with a laugh,
      chasing a porcupine that lumbered off and tried to hide its head under a
      stone. And when at last he ran out into the upper meadows behind the house
      he was no longer thinking of Green.
    </p>
    <p>
      But at noon the climbing party did not appear in the dining-room. At two
      o'clock, when the carriage appeared, there was no sign of them. At three
      the horse was still waiting and Halloran had gone back to his cigars. At
      half-past three he called the boy and ordered him shortly to take the
      horse back to the barn. At four the party, disheveled, flushed with
      exercise, laughing merrily together over the little jokes and incidents of
      the climb, came wearily up the walk. Halloran stood on the veranda and
      watched them as they climbed the steps. Margaret met him half-defiantly,
      half-apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she murmured, as she passed him, the last of the party; &ldquo;Mr.
      Green did take some sandwiches in his pockets. We&mdash;we went on about
      half way up the Wittenberg. I must change my things now; but if you still
      want to go I can be ready in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I've sent the horse back. You couldn't go now&mdash;you need a
      rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;with a little toss of her head, &ldquo;that's just as you like. We
      can go to-morrow, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I shall have to go away this afternoon.&rdquo; Here he was, forcing her
      to speak out and urge him; and she had no notion of being forced to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, must you go so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's too bad. You've not much more than got here. You really should
      have gone with us; we had a glorious climb. I'm all torn to pieces.&rdquo; She
      put out a shoe that was cut and tom in two or three places. &ldquo;I never
      worked so in my life before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran was thawing rapidly; he could not stand there looking at her and
      still keep all his resentment. And when she said, with an embarrassed
      little laugh, &ldquo;Well, I simply must go in,&rdquo; he delayed her:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret, wait just a minute. Haven't you anything to say to me. It all
      rests with you. If you would tell me&mdash;to stay&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not get further. She looked at him, then away. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;if
      you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; Of course you know best how much time you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned away impatiently, and she hurried into the house, pausing only
      to add, &ldquo;I shall be down in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But when the few minutes, lengthened to half an hour, had passed, and she
      had come down and looked with a curious expression into the parlours and
      out about the veranda, Halloran was half a mile away, driving rapidly
      toward the railway station in the junction village. And not until the
      evening did she know certainly that he had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      One Père Marquette train reached Wauchung early in the morning, to connect
      with the car-ferry across the lake; and this was the train that brought
      Halloran back home. Walking up the street, bag in hand, he met the
      Captain, who was getting home from the yards for breakfast. Craig stopped
      when he saw him, and waited. They shook hands with only a greeting, but
      the Captain's shrewd old eyes were searching Halloran's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mr. Halloran, we weren't looking for you quite so soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've taken the best part out of a week. I couldn't stay longer than that.
      I'll see you after breakfast and go over things. No news?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; everything's lovely. But say, Mr. Halloran, how about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran shook his head and would have hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw, now; it wasn't no, was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not exactly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say&mdash;then maybe it's all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's nothing, Captain&mdash;worse than nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean&mdash;you ain't telling me you've come back without either
      no or yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran made no answer. He simply wanted to get away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Halloran, I didn't think it of you; honest, I didn't. Say, now,&rdquo; he
      reached down and caught hold of the bag, not heeding Halloran's protest,
      &ldquo;let's step back this way. There hasn't a soul seen you&mdash;not a soul.&rdquo;
       His eyes swept the street. &ldquo;Just step along a little quicker. The early
      train 'll be pulling out before long, and you can pick up some breakfast
      at Reed City. I'd take you home with me&mdash;Jennie'd never peep&mdash;but
      I'm afraid some of the boys might be around when you come out, and anyhow
      you'd have to wait till the later train, and when you come to things like
      this time's worth saving. I guess prob'ly there's some other fellow
      hanging around down there these days and you've gone and given him a cool
      two days' start of you&mdash;you've just handed it to him. Now you get
      right back by the fastest train you can make. There's a good many things
      you know a heap more about than I do, but I guess maybe women ain't one of
      'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They reached the station, Halloran walking moodily without a word. At the
      edge of the platform he turned. &ldquo;Captain, do you really think I ought to
      do it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My boy, you've got to do it. You ain't going to lie down here, are you?
      And that's what it means if you don't. There's your train waiting there.
      You get right aboard before anybody shows up to ask questions. Good-by;
      good luck to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran got aboard, moody still; pulled up his collar, pulled down his
      hat, slid down low in the seat, and fixed his eyes on a worn spot in the
      back of the seat ahead. And when the train pulled into Reed City he was
      still gazing at the worn spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      The invigorating autumn air still held in Woodland Valley. Halloran,
      finding that the sleepy white horses and their driver were likely to be
      delayed in the village, threw his bag under a seat and set out on foot,
      following the road up through the notch by the bronze patches of
      cornstalks. He caught up a handful of young winter-green and munched it as
      he tramped. There was a lift in the air, and he threw open his coat and
      walked with a swing.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the house he asked for Miss Davies and was told that she was in her
      room, so he wrote a line in the library and gave it to a maid to take to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get your things, Margaret,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;let's go outside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;when did you come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just now. I walked up. I've been out to Wauchung since I saw you the
      other day, but there was no use trying to stay there. You see&mdash;what I
      said about being down here on business was all a fib&mdash;I was afraid to
      own up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid,&rdquo; she stood looking at him, with such a peculiar expression that
      he feared another delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind now; I'll tell you all about it when we get out. I want to
      walk up to the blackberry patch where I saw you the first day.&rdquo; She went
      without a word for her things, still with that odd, sober expression; and
      in a few moments they were walking up the path toward the lower slopes of
      the mountain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you said you had been to Wauchung?&rdquo; she remarked by way of
      breaking the silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I stayed there about twenty minutes. You see&mdash;I can laugh at it
      now, but I couldn't then&mdash;I've been sort of a fool. When I wrote
      those letters and you didn't answer, and then when I went to your house
      and found that you'd come down here without a word to me, I was all broken
      up, and my nerve just left me. And then finally I did manage to get down
      here, and you didn't seem very glad to see me, and I don't doubt I was
      jealous of the Green fellow. I had forgotten then that after that night in
      Evanston&mdash;that when you had once let me know what you let me know
      then&mdash;you never would change. You see, I know you better than you
      think, Margaret. I've seen since that it was my fault&mdash;that I've been
      expecting you to say things it was my business to say for myself&mdash;and
      that there couldn't anything but little misunderstandings come between us
      after&mdash;after that. And&mdash;and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He paused to look at her. She would have liked a broad hat, a sunbonnet,
      anything that would have shielded her face from him, but her little tarn
      was merciless, and she could only study the path. Another moment and he
      had to fall behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess that's all there is about it, Margaret. I was a fool, but
      I'm not a fool any longer. Here we are, where I saw you. Let's sit down on
      this log.&rdquo; She slipped to the ground and deliberately faced away from him,
      looking off at the tumbling slopes of Cross Mountain. But he came around
      to the other side. &ldquo;Now, Margaret, I've told you once, and you know all I
      could say without my telling you again. I love you: that's all. I can't go
      on any longer this way. I can't live without you&mdash;I've tried it&mdash;it's
      no use&mdash;so why can't we understand each other right now, and stop
      this playing at cross-purposes, and just be happy! You&mdash;you're all
      that I want in this world, Margaret&mdash;everything&mdash;everything.&rdquo; He
      was leaning forward, playing nervously with a thorny twig and eagerly
      searching her face. &ldquo;Tell me, Margaret&mdash;tell me if you will come
      right now into my life and make it worth something. I've been working day
      and night for other people&mdash;now I want to work for you. I want to see
      if I can't make a home for you&mdash;if I can't make you happy. When I've
      been working the hardest I've wondered, a good many times, what was the
      use of it all&mdash;what good it would do me if I should succeed, and make
      a lot of money and direct a lot of men. There's a passion for money, and
      there's a passion for power&mdash;I know a good many men that have one or
      the other or both of them&mdash;but one thing I've learned this year,
      Margaret, is that neither could ever fill my life and make it what I want
      to make it. Nothing, nobody but you can do that. Money and power mean
      worse than nothing to me unless they are means toward making you happy.
      That's what I want to do, Margaret, if you'll only give me the chance.
      Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a long, long time before she could do more than look off at the
      cloud-shadows floating up the opposite mountainside. They sat motionless;
      Halloran's hand had dropped from the twig; and the wonderful silence of
      the mountains wrapped them about. She wondered why he did not go on; he
      waited, breathless. She half turned; he caught her hand and gripped it
      with a nervous grasp. Her eyes sought the shadows again, wavered, were
      drawn, slowly, in spite of herself, to his face. And then he had her in
      his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, the glory of the painted mountains, the joy of the world about them! A
      hawk circled overhead, flew whistling off and lost himself in the forest.
      The squirrels and chipmunks, peering out from tree and rock, recalled
      their own young days and whisked away. The bees alone kept them company,
      but bee-workers have no time for love-making. And all those two knew was
      that the world was young and the world was many-tinted; that the sky was
      blue-and-white above; that all, everything, was theirs forever, in this
      world and in the world to come.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear girl,&rdquo; he murmured, with his lips at her ear, &ldquo;there is no mistake
      this time? This is for always?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Before the words were spoken her arms were around his neck, her lips were
      close to his, her heart was beating against his own. &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; she was
      repeating with him&mdash;&ldquo;always&mdash;always!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII&mdash;Three Announcements
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen they reached
      the house, a little late for dinner, they found a telegram for Halloran on
      the mail-rack. Margaret started at the sight of it. &ldquo;What is it, John?
      What does it mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He read it, then looked at it gloomily. &ldquo;I suppose I ought to be glad,&rdquo; he
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it good news? I never can wait to see what's in a telegram.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He handed it to her. &ldquo;I don't know whether you can make anything out of
      it. It is good news&mdash;it's what I've been hoping for for months. And
      now I'm sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Price has risen</i>&rdquo; she read. &ldquo;<i>Understand that combine is broken.
      Crosman</i>. What does that mean? What price? And who is Crosman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you all about it after dinner. I'm going to run up now and
      throw my things together. I shall have to take the evening train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;John!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could not reply; but with a quick look around the halls he took both
      her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't go, John. Why, it's&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, dear. It hurts&mdash;but I must.&rdquo; And then, afraid of that
      unmanageable little imp within him that had a way of taking the reins now
      and then, he only managed to add, &ldquo;I'll pack now so we can talk after
      dinner,&rdquo; and bolted upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a hasty dinner he found her waiting with her coat and hat on. &ldquo;I'm
      going to the station with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother thinks it will be all
      right, with Baker to drive. Now come out and tell me about it.&rdquo; After
      saying which, she herself began, as soon as they were pacing the veranda
      arm in arm, on an entirely different subject. &ldquo;I've talked with mother,
      John. I&mdash;I suppose I ought to have waited&mdash;it was really your
      place, wasn't it? But I'm so happy I couldn't wait. And dear old mother
      was so surprised&mdash;I was excited, I guess, and I laughed a little, and&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see her anyway, before I go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't now, John. She's so tired and stirred up she has gone right to
      bed. But&mdash;I don't think you'll find her very hard to talk with when
      you do see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she think she can give you up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were standing at the end of the veranda, and Margaret was leaning
      back with both hands on the railing. She shook her head and looked
      mischievously at him. &ldquo;I don't know but I shall have to be a little
      jealous of mother. I couldn't let many people talk about you like she
      does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had never seen her in such spirits. It was slowly coming to him
      that this was neither of the Margarets he had known in the past. He had
      never seen her so well, for one thing; and now, besides, she was happy.
      And all the playful tenderness, the mischief, the devotion of her honest
      heart were his. Was it a wonder, then, that she captivated him as never
      before? That her fancy played about him, and led his wits such a mad,
      happy chase that it was she, at the last, who had to tell him that the
      carriage was waiting for them and that they really must go! And as they
      rolled along toward the village&mdash;as the first mile-post gleamed in
      the moonlight and slipped away behind them; as the rushing Panther Kill
      roared a moment in their ears and then, too, slipped behind; as they
      passed the quarry and came slowly in sight of the red and green lights of
      the railroad, Halloran's heart failed him. They were on the back seat of
      the mountain wagon, deep in the shadow; she was in his arms for the last
      time until&mdash;when? They were dropping into silence as the parting drew
      near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Margaret,&rdquo; he whispered, &ldquo;I've been thinking&mdash;I can't go to-night&mdash;it's
      no use.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, John, don't go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll turn around&mdash;we'll go to-morrow night&mdash;you and your
      mother can start then, too&mdash;we'll all go West together. I'll wire
      Crosman to begin selling. Yes, we'll drive on to the station, and I'll
      send the message.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid, John, I couldn't get mother ready to go to-morrow. You don't
      quite understand&mdash;it would unsettle her dreadfully to get ready and
      go all in a rush like that. She has her mind made up for two weeks more&mdash;and
      I'm afraid I couldn't shorten it to less than one. Stay a week; it isn't
      much. You deserve a vacation. Mr. Crosman won't mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little imp already had his hands on the reins; but at the sound of the
      whistle, far up the Shandaken Valley, Halloran roused. &ldquo;I don't know what
      I'm thinking of, Margaret. They need me there. Good-by; don't say anything&mdash;I'm
      afraid I'll stay. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good&mdash;good-by, John. Write to me.&rdquo; She saw him on the train; she
      walked to the end of the platform to wave when his car passed; and then,
      deep in the gloom of the night, she walked slowly back to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran sent a message on ahead, and Crosman, all excitement, met him at
      the station.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all over, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; he burst out, as they shook hands. &ldquo;Mr.
      Corrigan's been down here to see you about advancing prices to cover
      losses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't need to advance prices. We haven't lost anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;he only went back last night. He says he hopes you'll write
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to it. Does Mr. Higginson know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only what Mamie could tell him. He wants to see you. I asked the doctor
      about it, and he says you can go in if you have some good news for him; if
      you haven't, you'd better stay away. I told him I guessed there wasn't
      much doubt about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go over after supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; I'll leave word so's they'll be ready. And say, Mr. Halloran,
      there's another thing. I was going to talk to Mrs. Higginson to-day about&mdash;about
      Mamie and me, but Mamie doesn't want me to. She says her mother wouldn't
      listen to a word from me. And we've been talking it over, and we wondered
      if you'd be willing to say a word for us.&rdquo; He hurried to add: &ldquo;I know it's
      sort of a funny thing to ask, but we're just up a tree. If I could see her
      father I could manage it, but it's pretty tough to go on like this and
      feel all the while that she's down on me.&rdquo; Halloran pursed his lips. &ldquo;It's
      Mrs. Higginson that you want me to talk to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, no&mdash;not since they're going to let you see him. Now don't you
      do it, Mr. Halloran, if you'd rather not. I know how&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I see a good chance I'll try to put in a word. You won't mind if I go
      in now and wash up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Say, it's mighty square of you&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind that. I suppose I'll see you this evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After supper Halloran walked around to the Higginson home and was met at
      the door by Mamie, blushing and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, Mr. Halloran,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Papa's been impatient to see you. You
      can go right up. Mamma asked me to excuse her to you. She isn't feeling
      well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Higginson, looking ten years older for his long sickness, was propped
      up in an arm chair. He smiled eagerly at the sight of his manager in the
      doorway, and held out his hand. &ldquo;Come in, John,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm glad to see
      you. Sit down. You've been having a little vacation, haven't you?&rdquo;
     </p>

      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;I've been East.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad of it. You deserve it. Now I want you to tell me all about
      things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran hesitated, looking at the white, wrinkled face and wondering if
      there was yet strength behind it to go into the details of the business.
      &ldquo;It's a good deal of a story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's ended, isn't it? Mamie's right in what she tells me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's about over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we've won?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we have. There isn't any combine now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Bigelow&mdash;&mdash;-?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigelow's broken. It was in the paper this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broken,&rdquo; Mr. Higginson repeated, half dazed. &ldquo;I didn't think our fight
      could break him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We didn't do it all. He's been punctured all around. I guess his Board of
      Trade deal hit him the hardest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this I've been hearing about this great lot of lumber in the yards&mdash;whose
      is it? I feel like Rip Van Winkle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's ours. When the trust cut prices we bought in all we could get.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&mdash;but where did you get the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From the National City.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're going to sell now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've begun already. It will just about cover our losses. I understand
      Corrigan wants to raise prices a peg or so, but I've been thinking we'll
      hold the advantage better if we refuse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've had a fire, I understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;didn't amount to much&mdash;less than the insurance premium
      would have cost us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever find out how it started?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;and no. It was done by a tramp. He claims he was smoking and
      fell asleep. We put the screws on him, but couldn't get a word more than
      that. They're still holding him, but I've about decided to let him go.
      There may be something behind it, of course, but if he won't tell I don't
      know who will. I hardly think it would pay us to push it any further.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not, so long as we're well out of it. Are you keeping a
      close watch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've put on an extra man since the fire.&rdquo; While he was answering
      these eager questions, Halloran had been looking for an opportunity to
      open the subject that was uppermost in his mind. Now, dropping his voice,
      he began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's one thing, Mr. Higginson&mdash;-&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But his employer did not hear. &ldquo;Who was this Le Duc I've been hearing
      about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's Captain Craig's son-in-law. Bigelow put him up as his operator in
      corn.&rdquo; Again his voice lost its assurance. &ldquo;I have something to tell&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Craig's son-in-law. Strange I never heard of him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't put it quite right&mdash;Le Duc married his granddaughter.
      Bigelow was Craig's son-in-law.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bigelow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;that makes Le Duc Bigelow's son-in-law. You see, the Captain's
      daughter has been found in Chicago, and he's brought her back home. She
      was divorced from Bigelow a good while back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Divorced from Bigelow!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It dawned on Halloran that he was stirring the old gentleman's brain into
      a muddle, and he stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess we won't go into it now, John&mdash;I seem to be a little tired.
      It's strange&mdash;strange. More seems to have happened in these months
      than in all the rest of my life put together. But didn't I interrupt you a
      moment ago? What were you going to say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran had no more than started, in that same altered voice, than a
      dress rustled behind him and Mr. Higginson broke in with: &ldquo;Come in, my
      dear. Here is John Halloran.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Higginson, becomingly pale, a pink-and-white shawl drawn about her
      shoulders, came languidly in and took Halloran's hand. &ldquo;Don't stand,&rdquo; she
      said; &ldquo;I heard your voice and thought I would come in for a moment. I am
      hardly able to get downstairs yet, but I try to walk about a little on
      this floor. Doctor Brown fairly orders me to keep very quiet, but I feel
      sure that a little exercise is the best thing. How are we ever to get
      about if we take no exercise? Don't you feel that draught, dear? John,
      would you mind shutting the door? I have to be a little careful about such
      things. I'm glad you've brought Mr. H. some good news. Doctor Brown said
      it was the one thing that might help him. 'Tell Mr. Halloran to come if he
      brings good news,' he said. 'If he doesn't, he'd better stay away.' Well,
      we've had a pretty serious time of it here, haven't we? I told Mr. H. he
      simply must get well&mdash;for what was to become of Mamie and me if he
      didn't. We haven't seen much of you lately, John. Of course, things have
      been rather broken up with my sickness, and Mr. H.'s., but I am sure Mamie
      would have been glad to see you any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John has been away,&rdquo; said Mr. Higginson.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, and Halloran, seeing his opportunity, girded up his
      courage and plunged forward. &ldquo;It's been a pretty important trip to me,&rdquo; he
      began. This was clumsy, but it was go ahead or nothing with him now, and
      he went ahead. &ldquo;Since I went away&mdash;I went down to see Margaret
      Davies, of Evanston; she has been staying down there, in the mountains&mdash;and
      she has promised to be my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The words were out. Mr. Higginson sat up straight in his chair and stared
      at him. Mrs. Higginson leaned back and stared. Halloran could only turn
      red. Finally, Mrs. Higginson, the first to recover, repeated the name,
      &ldquo;Margaret Davies! I've never heard any Evanston people speak of her. Has
      her family lived there long?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all her life&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Um&mdash;it's not a wealthy family, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess so. They have a fine old place on the Ridge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Mrs. Higginson's tongue failed her, and she rose to go. &ldquo;I hope you
      won't mind if I tell Mamie, Mr. Halloran. She will be interested.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, no; not at all. It's not a secret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We are all very glad to hear it. It's rather a sudden affair, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, dear, no. It's years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Years&mdash;indeed? I hope you'll do some very careful thinking. It is
      asking a good deal of a woman to bring her here to Wauchung&mdash;a city
      woman especially, with culture and refined tastes. I hope you aren't
      making a mistake. It would be such a pity for her life to turn out
      unhappily.&rdquo; She went out; and Halloran, after fidgeting a moment, began to
      think that the best thing he could do would be to go, too. But Mr.
      Higginson checked him. &ldquo;Sit down, John; sit down. So you're going to be
      married? Well, I'm glad to hear it. Let me shake hands with you.&rdquo; Halloran
      was nervous and he rose again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a minute; I haven't said what I wanted to see you about yet. There's
      a matter that's been in my mind a good deal while I've been lying here,
      and I guess this is a good time to bring it up. I jotted down some
      memoranda this morning&mdash;there on the table, those folded papers. I
      wish you'd take them with you and look them over. I want your opinion on
      them before we do anything about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Halloran took the papers, opened the first one, and ran his eye over it.
      At the first words he started, flushed, muttered something, and looked up,
      speechless with gratitude. &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; Mr. Higginson interrupted. &ldquo;Never mind giving your
      decision now. Go home and think it over. If you see anything about it that
      you think could be improved, talk it over with me the next time you come
      around and I guess we won't make much difficulty over it. Higginson &amp;
      Halloran doesn't look quite so well as Higginson &amp; Co. A shorter name
      would look better. But we never did go in much for looks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need to think over this, Mr. Higginson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Take it along; take it along. I guess I've talked enough for this
      afternoon. I'm a little tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to do now but to go. As he passed down the stairs he saw
      Crosman and Mamie standing anxiously in the parlour doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did they say anything about our coming up?&rdquo; said Crosman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Halloran stopped short. &ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; he said; and then: &ldquo;Say, I'm sorry, but
      I clean forgot you. It comes to the same thing, anyhow; I never could have
      said a word. I guess it's up to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood aside. Mamie looked at Crosman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say, Mamie, where is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In her room, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go up ahead, Mamie, and find out if I can see her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So with a dejected expression, Mamie piloting him, Crosman started up the
      stairs just as Halloran left the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII&mdash;Leveling Down
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>argaret and
      Halloran were married in the late spring. For their honeymoon they went
      back to the mountains at the time when the apple buds were bursting into
      billows of pink and white in hillside orchards. The song-sparrows and
      robins sang for them as they drove up from the village; the brook,
      boisterous with a burden drained from higher slopes where the snow still
      lingered under northern ledges, brawled almost at the carriage wheels;
      millions of violets dotted the roadside, and white strawberry blossoms and
      the first daisies, and forget-me-nots that had escaped from some old-time
      garden. The smell of spring was in the air, the intoxicating sense of
      youth and health and happiness. And as they rolled comfortably along
      behind the jogging white horses they could only look at each other and
      draw in deep breaths of the fragrant, buoyant air, and be glad.
    </p>
    <p>
      Their first climb was up to the blackberry patch, under the maples. As
      they sat there on a well-remembered log, and looked out on the green
      wonder of the opposite slope, where the cloud-shadows were mounting as on
      that day of the autumn before, Margaret slipped her hand into Halloran's.
      &ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Far back in the hollow of the mountain a winter wren was caroling,
      welcoming them back to the highlands with all the melody in his little
      throat. His neighbours took it up, and piped their shrillest; and all
      along the slope chirped the dainty babel of welcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;John,&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Margaret.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They can't send you any telegrams now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wouldn't do them any good if they did. I've ordered the station agent
      to hold all messages until I call for them, and I'm not going to call.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She smiled; and again they were silent, listening to the merry strains
      behind them and to the far-off sounds from the valley, and watching the
      men at work in the fields below.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have followed them thus far, but now, in telling an odd incident of
      this little journey, we take leave. One evening, at supper, some active
      bodies at the house busied themselves in getting up an expedition to the
      village. There was to be a &ldquo;show&rdquo; in the village hall. These things were
      said to be great fun, and Margaret and Halloran were in the first wagon
      that went down. A band of broken-down actors, the latest coon songs, an
      elaborate silver table set to be raffled off&mdash;a number being given
      with each and every ticket sold to the performance&mdash;these were the
      attractions. It was hinted that the same silver set would probably figure
      again in other years; for the raffle included all the towns along the
      railroad, and the winning ticket seemed always to be held in some other
      town. But the natives of the mountains were always glad to be swindled,
      and silverware was not to be resisted. Small farmers, who build shingled
      bay windows and buy cabinet organs before the rear of the house is boarded
      up, fall an easy prey to these allurements. So the hall was crowded, and
      the party found some difficulty in getting seats.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the cracked piano began to jingle.. The janitor lighted the
      lamps that served for footlights, and a voice, somewhere behind the
      curtain, was heard singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The giggling, chatting audience was hushed. The kerosene lamps smoked and
      flickered unheeded. A village aristocrat, daughter of the general
      storekeeper, with her gum-chewing escort, sat next to Halloran, rapt with
      expectancy. The voice swelled out louder and louder, as it approached the
      refrain. Margaret, finding the audience more odorous and less picturesque
      than she had looked for, turned to suggest an early departure, and was
      surprised to see her husband leaning forward, his hands on the back of the
      chair in front, his eyes fixed on the stage. There were signs that the
      curtain was to be drawn; and as the voice swung into the refrain, &ldquo;For
      Golden-haired Mary, dee-doodle-dee-fairy, dee-iddle-dee airy,
      ta-raddle-my-own,&rdquo; the singer was disclosed, a long-legged black-face
      comedian, in a gorgeous, if shabby, cake-walk costume. Halloran muttered,
      &ldquo;Well, I'm blest!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, John?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know him? It's Apples!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, Le Duc, after a vain chase for the gold that glitters above
      the corn-pit on the Board of Trade, had returned to the path that leads to
      Shakespeare. The Bard was not quite within hail, to be sure, for Apples
      had lost his place in the line and must begin farther back than ever, but
      the road was still there. As they watched and listened, a woman, also in
      black-face, joined the comedian; and they recognized his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Halloran walked to the village after breakfast for a talk
      with Le Duc, but the &ldquo;company&rdquo; had left by an early train. &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo;
       he said to Margaret when they talked it over later in the day; &ldquo;there's
      not much use being sorry for them. They'd have landed on this level sooner
      or later anyhow&mdash;nothing could stop them. And he can't do anything
      like the harm with his silver-set swindle that he could have if Bigelow
      had succeeded in putting his deal through.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a little sorry for Lizzie, though. I used to think she might amount
      to something. You see, John, I can't quite forget that if it hadn't been
      for her and George we might not&mdash;maybe we wouldn't have come to know
      each other so well.&rdquo; They were walking in the orchard. As she spoke she
      picked a cluster of apple blossoms and turned to pin them on his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; he said, looking down at her and smiling, &ldquo;but I don't
      know. Maybe we'd have landed on this level, too, no matter how we started.
      I like to think so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up with one of the quick, shy glances he was learning to
      expect; and as quickly looking down again, and lowering her head over the
      blossoms, she murmured, &ldquo;So do I.&rdquo;
     </p>

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
